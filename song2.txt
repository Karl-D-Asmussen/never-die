She's so sweet when she slumbers
I myself, haven't slept a wink
It is the greatest of wonders
To sleep and not to think

She's so sweet when she stirs
When she stretches catlike, long and lithe
And when she says that she prefers
What she dreamt tonight

She's so sweet when she blushes
When her cheeks quickly redden bright
Oh so sweet when she wishes
If maybe I would like---

She's so sweet when she says
I
