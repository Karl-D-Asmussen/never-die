Write a New York Times' Bestseller
Donate to an institute
Compose a song to sing for students
  in an end-of-term salute

Fashion up a spring collection
Put your name upon a gun
Be the extra in the perfume
  pretty women will put on

Speak a word that will grow winged
Put a flag upon a peak
Run in under three short minutes
  a fifteen hundred meter streak

Cross a monkey with a rabbit
Meet the king and get a prize
Build a house to stand forever
  or just set it all ablaze

We are gonna live forever
We are never gonna die
We are gonna live forever
We are never gonna die
We are never gonna die
