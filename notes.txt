Ephemeral
Alright.... a femme warlock, I think... or maybe engineer. When she's holding still, she looks entirely human (if implausibly curvy and perky and pretty) except for how she kind of... doesn't have a dicernable skin color. When she moves the (entirely physical) illusion breaks, revealing her flesh to be transparent like clear gel, with a human-function but not human-form skeleton that is basically geiger-art carved from emerald. She's human, femme-biased pansexual, sub-biased switchy, and nectar has made her flesh almost goo-girl esque but only mostly in appearance; she's extremely elastic and a total size queen to go with it.
Also she is a total cinamon roll.
But also very meticulous and stuff.
and she is kind of kuudere about that
she's kuu under stress basically, the worse the emergency, the cooler her head.
