<div class="slo">
<p><em>Do you want to return the favor?</em></p>
<p>With a sly grin on eir face, Morgan asks me that, as if our relationship is transactional and not a thing of transcendence. As if every time we kiss, eir saliva isn’t the sweetest symphony of bliss on my tongue. As if my nectar doesn’t transform into what is essentially a tailor-made-to-me <em>catnip</em> at eir touch — I’ve heard some complain of their sweat-reactive nectar, and I can’t relate.</p>
<p>As if the pure happiness radiating off em isn’t brushing away my mirrored grief like a warm breeze.</p>
<p>I’ve got a goofy look on my face, and a devious plan in my mind.</p>
<p>“I’m gonna lift you up now,” I say.</p>
</div>
<p>Sloane reaches down with eir upper arms, sliding eir hands under the elastic of my underwear and taking a firm grip of my hips. With an effortless heave, e lifts me up in the air — and I yelp in surprise. For some reason the first thought I have is: <em>e’d be an amazing Charleston partner.</em></p>
<p>Then, eir second pair of hands dexterously relieve me of my underwear — it is utterly exhilarating how much an extra set of hands makes possible. Tossing them aside, e takes a hold of my bare legs and guide me to hook my calves between eir arms on either side and under eir lower shoulders, leaving me straddling eir chest.</p>
<p>E props emself up with one of the large, firm, black pillows, and takes hold of my hands and puts them on eir horns, then e puts two hands on my buttocks and guides my hips to eir face. My cock meets eir lips, and push past the silky soft lips into a warm, wet oasis. I hiss as eir dexterous tongue rolls back my foreskin, and look down to see eir golden eyes looking back up at me, expectantly.</p>
<p>Against the back of my thighs, I feel eir lower set of shoulders move, and I look over my shoulder to see em being stroking emself, one hand pumping languidly on eir still hard cock, while the other disappears between eir relaxed legs.</p>
<p>Looking back down at em, I smile and lick my lips, and e winks back. Then I slowly push in to the base, and e takes my entire length with only a smile of eirs to show for it. E is burning hot around my cock, snug and slick. Eir tongue gently caresses the underside of my cock, and the roof of eir mouth is soft, as if eir entire palate was velum.</p>
<p>I pull back, and buck my hips against eir face, gasping with the intensity of the stimulation, and eir hands roam over my buttocks and up my back. Then there’s another pair of hands on my thighs — did e get tired of stroking emself?</p>
<p>Then a pair of hands begin massaging the soles of my feet, and I cast a look behind me to see Sloane has grown eight arms; the lowest pair <em>backwards</em>, to properly give me a foot massage.</p>
<p>“<em>Fuck,</em>” I breathe, in amazement. Then Sloane swallows hard around my cock, and I turn my attention back to making love to eir face. I begin rhythmically thrusting, adjusting my grip on to eir horns for better leverage, relishing the incredible feeling of being so comprehensively caressed while getting head.</p>
<p>It barely lasts a minute before I feel the pressure of orgasm building in my groin, and I pick up speed until I am slamming my pubic mound against eir nose-tip — which e doesn’t seem to mind at all — and then I come with a drawn out moan.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>A succubus cannot subsist on lust alone, and just as E did to me, I greedily drink eir come. It fills my stomach with warmth as I do; familiar as the sensation is, this is somehow even more comfortable.</p>
<p>Morgan’s face contorted in orgasmic bliss is something I’d commit to stone and store away for dark times if I had the skill with a chisel. I feel like I could grow twenty feet and put on a ton of mass with a thought; the radiance of lust flowing though me is blindingly intense.</p>
<p>My own second orgasm rises, and I spew my own nectar all over my belly and leak it on the sheets under my ass.</p>
</div>
<p>My orgasm ebbs, and I recline against eir strong hands, moving up to support me. With a sensual <strong><em>pop</em></strong>, my achingly sensitive cock leaves eir mouth, trailing a thread of clear slime — nectar — tinted by the blue light inside eir mouth.</p>
<p>Awkwardly, on shaking legs, and with help, I get my calf out from under eir shoulder and fall over next to eir on the large bed. Only then do I notice the pool of nectar on eir abs, reaching from the tip of eir semi-flaccid cock to the underside of eir perky breasts.</p>
<p>Grinning like an idiot, I force myself up on all fours and crawl over to lick it off while Sloane strokes my head. I have no idea how long it takes, all I think about is the next mouthful of superstimulus in liquid form.</p>
<p>Once e is clean, while it would be super hot to have round two, I am too exhausted to do anything but curl up and for the first time in my life be an actual little spoon. Sloane pulls a blanket of dark fabric over us from somewhere, and sleep takes me.</p>
<hr />
<p>Warmth and light fill my consciousness, followed by the sensation of intimate closeness against my back. The bedsheets are black as night, and I am in the nude. It wasn’t a dream or a hallucination, and I am very happy for it.</p>
<p>I scoot a little closer to Sloane behind me.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Good morning.”</p>
</div>
<p>There’s something in eir voice; a bit of a rasp. I scoot a little more and turn over in that halting, step-by-step manner you have to use when there isn’t enough room to just roll. Sloane lies there, as gorgeous as ever in the light of day, with tears streaming down eir face.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Nothing — it’s tears of joy. You had a sad dream, too, that may have helped it along.”</p>
</div>
<p>I reach out — not very far, as we are face-to-face — and wipe eir tears away with a thumb. “None of that,” I say, and pull em into a kiss by the chin. I will never tire of that flavor — no, not a ‘that flavor’. I will never tire of the way e tastes like <em>everything, all at once.</em></p>
<p>Then, rather than getting pulled into some before-breakfast action, I sit up; then stand up, and walk out of bed towards the shower. Not so much to shower, but to utilize the full-length mirror that makes up the wall next to the open shower stall.</p>
<p>I feel good. My body feels responsive in a way it hasn’t since I turned 25. Light, agile, dexterous. It’s been about sixteen hours since the last time I used the bathroom, but I feel no need to relieve myself. Is that nectar’s effect too? I guess expelling waste is an un-sexy and inconvenient facet of life that I would rather be free of.</p>
<p>I used to be somewhat vain. I didn’t kick the habit of looking at myself in the mirror when I no longer felt like I had anything worth looking at, and by then it became almost a self-harm thing, to look at my beginning thirty-something flab and let dysphoria kick me to the curb. Suffice it to say I am familiar with my physical inadequacies.</p>
<p>And yet, here I stand, my beginning pot belly looking like an amateur athlete’s. My trunk-like thighs built from a teenage hood of riding a bike everywhere are slimmer, and definitely hairless — getting some laser treatment was one of the things I put off in my grief because I didn’t feel I deserved it. The only body hair I have left is an artful, light coat on my lower legs and lower arms, and then the happy trail Angie used to like, and a tuft of fur in place of pubes, much like Sloane.</p>
<p>I flex, and watch my muscles move under my skin — toned, not cut. A dancer’s physique.</p>
<p>Sloane comes up to me and gives my ass a playful slap, then wraps six arms around me and rests eir chin on my head.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Somebody’s happy to look at emself.”</p>
</div>
<p>I look at Sloane in the reflection. E’s a little blurry, since I haven’t put in my contacts yet.</p>
<p>Wait. I fell asleep after our stellar lovemaking session, and never took out my contacts. I free myself of Sloane’s embrace, and step close to the reflective surface and true enough, there over my cornea sits the culprit. With a trained hand, I remove both, and then I see clearly and unaided. For the first time in twenty-four years.</p>
<p>This leads me to examine my wrist where a childhood misadventure got me a compound fracture which left an ugly, purple scar. Smooth skin. Other imperfections like my bent rib, and my slightly too deep solar plexus are gone too. My skin is clear and smooth and even a little <em>tanned.</em> My fingernails are short and neat, my hands and feet are free of callouses.</p>
<p>Hell, my <em>cock</em> is straighter.</p>
<p>I haven’t had any caffeine for sixteen hours, and as a seven-cups-a-day person, that should have me in withdrawal <em>right now.</em></p>
<p>“Nectar is a hell of a drug,” I mutter.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yeah. I read a few books on that, if you want me to, I can brief you on some of the common effects.”</p>
</div>
<p>I shake my head. “I can’t imagine there’ll be an unpleasant surprise in there,” I say, and then I step back to Sloane, and e wraps eir six arms around me again. “I like the way you just have whatever number of arms you want to at any given time.”</p>
<p>E giggles.</p>
<p>“What’s the plan for today?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I’ll key you to my door, and then we need to start you on learning Infernal. I need to go consult our warlock on—” I stop. This needs some explaining.</p>
<p>In a smooth motion, I sling an arm under Morgan’s knee pits and lift em in a bridal carry.</p>
<p>In the light of ship-day, the pentagram on my floor is obvious. “Well, magic.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Magic?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“What I think you need, most of all, is about six months worth of nectar, like, <em>yesterday.</em> Gradual transformation is cute and all, but you and I both know the destination matters more than the journey with such things.”</p>
<p><em>Wow.</em> That was an intense spike of fondness.</p>
</div>
<p>I nuzzle up against em. “You say the nicest things.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I steady myself, because explaining is more important than fawning over my lover. “Since I’m a succubus, I can be summoned and bound with the proper ritual, and as part of that, succubi can be… <em>Tweaked</em> in function when the ritual is dismissed. One of the more famous and useful ways is what’s called a ‘wellspring dismissal,’ which lets me produce more nectar.”</p>
</div>
<p>“I can see why that would be good.” I tap Sloane’s arm, and e lets me down.</p>
<p>I squat down and inspect the engraving in the floor. It’s no mere pentagram — there’s an inscribing circle <em>and</em> pentagon. Along the rim, neatly engraved, is two rows of symbols. “Infernal?” I ask, pointing.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Correct.”</p>
</div>
<p>It looks reminiscent of <em>katakana</em> or <em>hangul</em>. I stand up, and rub my chin while considering the problem. “I have a question,” I say.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yes?”</p>
</div>
<p>I turn to em. “You’re a shapeshifter. What are your limitations?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“As I said, I’m third-tier. I can do <em>anything.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>“May I make some requests?” I ask, and remember eir aversion to the notion e voiced. “Purely for science, of course.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I catch the apologetic note, but at this point it’s not like I wouldn’t do <em>anything</em> for Morgan. I smirk. “— Of <em>course.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>“Can you turn your fingernail into magnesium?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>That gives me pause. “Like, I can make it very hard and sharp, but why <em>magnesium?</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>“Humor me — do you have some cutters?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I gesture to the chests by the wall that contain my odds and ends. Tools, costumes, weapons, and whatever else I need. I may be the ship empath, but Raven makes it perfectly clear that nobody gets on board without useful skills.</p>
<p>Wanayoike is here purely on the merit that he doesn’t mind doing everybody’s menial odd-jobs, not to mention doing everybody if needed be.</p>
<p>Turning my nail shiny and hard is easy. Turning it into magnesium is tricky, but I am pretty sure I got it when Morgan returns with cutters and a blowtorch.</p>
<p>“I think I got it but what—”</p>
</div>
<p>I put down the blow torch and take eir hand. Gingerly, I position the cutters’ beak under eir nail, and snip off a fragment of it.</p>
<p>I put the fragment on the floor and turn on the hand-held blow torch. Touching the blue flame to the metal ignites the reaction — blindingly bright white combustion. “Yeah, okay, that confirms it.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Confirms what?”</p>
</div>
<p>“You can shapeshift into arbitrary shapes <em>and</em> materials,” I say. “<em>Meaning</em> you are not bound by some ability to rearrange biological tissue — if that is in fact what succubi are made of. I’m playing fast and loose with assumptions here.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” I admit.</p>
</div>
<p>“I come from a place without magic,” I say. “I have no assumptions about any of this, and I spent most of my creative life imagining ways to take over the world given supernatural abilities.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Oh. I’ve mostly been scrabbling to piece together enough skills to go with Raven.”</p>
</div>
<p>I nod. “That’s okay. We’re complementary; I can’t grow extra arms. Next question: is there any conceivable reason why you can’t just produce nectar at will?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Well, it’s— nectar is a product of lust, and succubi produce it when we are sexually satisfied.”</p>
</div>
<p>“From what I can tell, most succubi are subject to a fixed body plan. Why can’t <em>you</em> just produce nectar? If you need, we can have sex, but you said we needed a <em>lot</em> of nectar, so I am asking you if we need a magic ritual, or if you can do it by virtue of being… Well, <em>you.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>The wave of lust and appreciation radiating from em is already making me salivate, making me hard, making me <em>wet.</em> “Uh, maybe. I… I’ve never tried.”</p>
</div>
<p>I raise an eyebrow, taking a step closer, and then another so our bodies are pressed together. “Why?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“It’s never come up. Sex has always just been for fun and sustenance, I never—”</p>
</div>
<p>“I never either,” I say. “Let’s <em>try.</em>” I put my hand behind eir neck and pull em into a kiss. Eir hands find my hips and I sling my arms around eir shoulders and hop onto eir hips. With eir hard cock rubbing against my ass, and my own pressed against eir stomach, e carries me to the bed.</p>
<p>E slams me down on the mattress and kisses me hungrily, and I wrap my legs around eir hips, and my hands play with eir hair, tied in a now-messy braid.</p>
<p>A hand of eirs finds my cock and eirs in the same slick grip, and e starts slowly pumping the both of us. I groan into the kiss.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>Okay, let’s give it a try.</em></p>
</div>
<p>Eir long tongue enters my mouth, and I feel it change shape into a tubular, rigid structure, as if filled with cartilage. My tongue probes the tip, and I find an opening. A trickle of nectar flows from it, and I drink greedily. Then it retracts from my mouth after far too little time, and Sloane rises back up away from me.</p>
<p>A set of eir six hands pull my legs away from eir hips, and e lets go of my cock. Instead e moves to straddle me, and I get to behold a mesmerizing sight of eir own cock vanishing into eir folds, eventually becoming a clitoris. I look up at eir face and see the proboscis-like tongue peeks from between eir lips.</p>
<p>Then e rises above me, and my hands find eir hips, one of eir hands find my cock and guide it to eir cunt, and then e plunges me into eir burning hot depths and I can’t help but buck against eir wonderful sex, ineffectual as it is trapped under two hundred pounds of succubus.</p>
<p>E lowers onto me, and our lips meet, then part, and eir tongue enters my mouth once again. E starts grinding against me, rhythmically gyrating eir hips back and forth rather than bouncing. I dimly recognize it as the method of stimulation espoused by Sybian to most readily bring climax to someone with a cunt.</p>
<p>And then I don’t particularly care whether I orgasm or not, because the nectar begins flowing in earnest from eir tongue, even more than eir orgasmic ejaculation, and it doesn’t stop. I lose myself willingly in the bliss.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>It’s playfully easy, to come and instead of gushing from my cunt or ejaculating from my cock, just push it out through my tongue. The wave of lust and euphoria that comes off Morgan — the <em>fulfillment</em> — is to die for.</p>
<p>I stop, as I feel eir orgasm building, and I withdraw my tongue from eir mouth.</p>
</div>
<p>“Why did you stop?” I ask.</p>
<p>Then e starts bouncing on my cock, and I feel the tightness in my pelvis. A moan escapes my lips and I take hold of eir hips and plant my feet against the mattress, and start pounding into em far faster than gravity allows bouncing.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I lean down and whisper “<em>feel this,</em>” in eir ear, and make a swallowing motion with my cunt — there’s muscles wrapped around eir cock that no human woman would have.</p>
<p>My cunt is a feeding orifice. Every face of a succubus’ body is designed to facilitate sex.</p>
</div>
<p>The sudden suction pulls me over the edge and I groan and buck against eir hips, blowing my load deep into eir innermost parts, and eir cunt greedily drinks it.</p>
<p>My orgasm ebbs, and e runs three sets of hands sensually over eir body, one going over eir lips, eir fingers into eir mouth and e suckles on them, never breaking eye contact with me.</p>
<p>Eir cunt sucks on my cock again, and I groan — it is way too intense on my raw member. “I don’t think I can go again this soon,” I mutter.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“No need.”</p>
</div>
<p>E raises emself, letting my cock flop onto my belly, and bends over backwards, lifting eir hips off me entirely, supporting emself on a multitude of hands in a contortionist’s handstand. Almost reminiscent of a scorpion.</p>
<p>I prop myself up on my elbows. “You’re enjoying yourself,” I say. Really, what more can I ask for? What more do I want? In this moment, nothing; though in general the world could do with less suffering. I shove the thought aside and push myself up to sitting.</p>
<p>E comically crawls forward on eir six arms, and kisses me, tail lashing under my chin. Then in one smooth motion, swirls eir legs under em and between mine. Strong arms pull me close and e rolls us both over, leaving me straddling em.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I am having way too much fun.</p>
</div>
<p>“You’re not saying much,” I say, and run a finger between eir breasts. “Cat’s got your tongue?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I roll my long tongue languidly out for the world to see, then pull it back between my teeth in a licking motion. “There’s a crude joke to be made here about licking pussy,” I say, which gets me a snort.</p>
</div>
<p>One of eir hands gingerly starts playing with my cock, carefully avoiding anything too stimulating. Under me, I feel again the presence of eir cock, and reach down behind me to run a finger up eir vulva only to find that gone. Instead I get a handful of smooth furry balls — three of them.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>It’s not like I need them, but they add some nice weight.</p>
</div>
<p>E opens eir mouth again, and eir tongue lolls out, this time as a long cyan-blue tubular tentacle with that same opening at the end. It snakes across eir belly, leaving a slimy trail of nectar and finds eir cock. I watch mesmerized as it envelops eir length in the strangest possible show of autofellatio. It pulls back, and leaves eir cock slick and glistening with a thick layer of nectar on it, and my heart begins pounding.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“U ow u an eeh,” — <em>you know you want it</em> — I articulate eloquently around the massive tendril coming out of my mouth.</p>
</div>
<p>Gentle hands guide me up eir belly, and another pair of hands position eir — rather large — cock between my buttocks. “Please,” I breathe, and close my eyes. <em>Please, god, yes.</em></p>
<div class="slo">
<p>The spike of pure <em>want</em> is so sharp my teeth hurt.</p>
<p>I push against eir tight hole, and my well-lubricated cock pushes in with only some resistance. Slowly, I work my way in, while enjoying Morgan’s beautiful reaction, mouth open, brow slightly furrowed, and eyes screwed shut.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long before eir taint push against my mound. “U an oen ur eye ow,” — <em>you can open your eyes now.</em></p>
</div>
<p>It is intense, filling. I have never had one this large. My cock jitters achingly, and as I open my eyes, I see Sloane’s tentacle tongue rise up and slide over my cock. The inside has a texture like eir cunt — which is to say five to six times nicer to put your dick in than the most exquisite thing money or genes can buy.</p>
<p>Slowly, I raise myself up, savoring the feeling, and then I plunge down as quickly as my lack of practice permits.</p>
<p>Sloane puts a hand on my head behind my ear, and I hear a buzz.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>Can you hear me?</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>“How—” I manage, gasping with the intese feeling of eir cock twitching inside me.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>Sound conduction through your skull. Can’t speak around this sexy thing.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>Eir hands om my hips raise me up, and e plants eir feet on the mattress, and begins slowly thrusting. I feel eir tip rub across my prostate like a pressure cooker about to explode. “I’m gonna—”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>Shush.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>So soon after my first orgasm, I come again. This one more drawn out, less intensely centered in my groin. Sloane pumps away in my ass with abandon.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>Get ready— Oh god!</em>”</p>
<p>The taste of eir seed <em>inside</em> my tongue pushes me over the edge. I come, and open the floodgates. Pounding away, I come, and come, and come, losing track of time in the pleasure.</p>
<p>Morgan comes again, while I just never stop, pumping em full of all the nectar I can possibly muster.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>A buzzer goes off, and through the haze of orgasmic bliss, I see the door flow open in front of me, and captain Raven walks in, turning ninety degrees as she descends the ramp.</p>
<p>Sloane bends eir neck back to look.</p>
<p>«Sloane, Morgan, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for watch-long lovemaking sessions with your new toy, I have to interrupt you two. Radaffo and Abteen have run afoul of each other again, and I can’t interfere without taking sides.»</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>Right, forgot the time. This is embarrassing.</em>”</p>
<p>I look up at Morgan, apologetically. “<em>My conflict resolution skills are needed.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>“Huh… ’S okay… Rain check?” I slur.</p>
<p>E nods, and the tendril retracts from my sore cock, turning into a tongue again as it retreats into eir mouth.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Give me a ges, captain.»</p>
</div>
