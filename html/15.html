<h1 class="title">chapter 15</h1>
</header>
<p>I awake to an empty bed which is tremendously distressing. Looking about I see our room is even emptier. I jump out of bed, forming traction pads under my feet, and run for the door in quick, bouncy steps.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>⟨Horizon.⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>I feel a warmth originating in my mind and experimentally project a vocalizable thought at wherever it came from. <em>⟨Clemency?⟩</em> I ask, even as I slam on the door-opening panel. The sections of the door slide apart and I dart through, sideways.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>⟨You’re awake!⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>Turning towards the lounge-end of the ship, I take off at a light run. <em>⟨Where are you?⟩</em></p>
<hr />
<div class="slo">
<p>«Morgan’s awake,» I say, turning an eye-stalk towards the door.</p>
<p>Ramaeshwara nods. «I’ll fudge the paperwork for you.»</p>
<p>«Thank you, Ramesh.»</p>
<p>«Go, you silly succubus, don’t dawdle!» He claps his hands.</p>
<p>I turn and dart on six legs to the door, whipping a tentacle ahead to open it, and burst into the spine of the Gehenna.</p>
<p>«Have fun!» Jaya adds, from the futon off the other side of their room.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Before me, a few dozen cubits further down the hallway, a door opens and an eight-legged snake-like monster bursts out.</p>
<p>I stop time to take it in, and the momentary confusion is replaced by recognition.</p>
<p>The four slender eye-stalks says <em>Beholder</em>, while the serpentine tail and many legs says <em>Behir.</em> The two front-pointing horns says <em>Tarrasque,</em> while the feline legs and paws — two sets front and two sets hind — says <em>Displacer Beast.</em> A plethora of tentacles attached to the back could be anything from <em>Displacer Beast</em> or <em>Otyugh</em> to <em>Flump</em> or <em>Grick.</em> The general bodyplan says both <em>Lamia</em> and <em>Gynosphinx.</em></p>
<p>The face is completely featureless save for a mouth with impossibly full, kissable lips, framed in black curly hair. The four eyes on stalks have round pupils in amber irises, the dark fur of the legs is patterned with orange stripes, while the characteristic red Tarrasque-esque (hah!) armor plating continues down the tail, offsetting the bluish underbelly which transitions from a pale skinned curvacious feminine physique with full breasts sporting grey arealoas, and a patch of black curly fur in place of pubic hair.</p>
<p>Blue, red, stripes, and a physiology put together from my favorite entries in the <em>Monster Manual.</em> Overall size is human, save for the ’taur physiology.</p>
<p>Time resumes. Eir elation floods over me.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨Hey babe.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨Clemency.⟩</span><br />
⟨Horizon.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨I was so worried.⟩</span><br />
⟨I know.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨I love your new look.⟩</span><br />
⟨I know.⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>The sheer <em>want</em> is almost overwhelming; peppered with happiness and my own realization that I’m sensing eir emotion directly.</p>
<p>In an eyeblink, Sloane upon me. I wrap my arms around eir neck and four feline paws wrap around my hips and cheeks. We kiss, deeply — I’m treated to a long prehensile tongue, steeped in hot nectar that both burns and chills and tastes like every spice in the Bazaars of Themiscyra at once. I’m lifted off my feet and pushed against the wall, as eir knee rides up between my legs.</p>
<p>At every surface of contact I feel a strange metaphorical tingling; as if nuclear fusion takings place when we touch. I lean into the sensation and Sloane <em>moans.</em></p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨Let’s get some privacy?⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨Don’t care.⟩</span><br />
⟨All right.</em> 😉<em>⟩</em></p>
</div>
<div class="slo">
<p>There’s a tinge of sadness and logning in eir mind, and I want nothing other than to snuff it out with love in copious quantities. And oh my gods and stars I’m hungry and whatever Morgan is doing it is like I’ve been made a conduit for the entire output of a mid-sized powerplant and we’re not even past foreplay.</p>
<p>I shed my extra legs, the bulk of my tail and dorsal amor in favor of buttocks to grope and the possibility of fucking me from behind; I leave the barest hint of armored scales to enhance the contours of my scapula, spine and iliac crest.</p>
<p>My claws stay sheathed even as I want to hold Morgan close forever and never let go. My tendrils run up eir belly and under eir shirt; into eir shorts. E raises eir arms and I deftly slide off the garments, briefly breaking the kiss and my hold on eir head.</p>
<p>I lift em from the wall and with no small amount of force, bring em against the floor in the adjacent cubit-deep niche for passing from floor-to-ceiling. Not so much for privacy as for a more enclosed space with walls for leverage.</p>
<p>Under my grasp, I feel the amor-like scales on eir spine spread to cover eir shoulder blades and tail bone.</p>
</div>
<div class="mo center">
<p><em>⟨Thank you for making me this body.⟩<br />
<span class="slo">⟨You’re welcome, but I also kind of did it for me.⟩</span><br />
⟨There’s several points of oversight though, if you accept constructive criticism?⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>A tendril snakes its way from her back into the socket in my chest. There’s a truly <em>incredible</em> sense of connection, and my breath catches in my throat.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨I can do you one better; I’ve got editing privileges still.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨That is so hot you have no idea.⟩</span><br />
⟨I have</em> every <em>idea.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨Okay, just going down the list—⟩</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>Of course, I already <em>have</em> ultraviolet color vision, I’ve just been ignoring it because coming up with names for new colors is an activity best left for when you’re not about to have your brains fucked out.</p>
<p>We break the kiss long enough for me to look at my hand, where an extra thumb grows on the other side of my palm. Below and behind me shoulders, another set shoulder emerges; on my chest, another set of pectorials attach to my ribcage, bulging under the skin. Extra arms emerge from my sides, and I immediately put my new hands on eir full tits, testing out how much better an extra thumb makes me at groping.</p>
<p>I wrap my legs around eir hips, and my feet streamline themselves; leaving only three toes, one flat and wide for plantar stability, one longer and sturdy for kickoff, and one extending downwards from the heel for load-bearing and grasping; essentially the foot design e sported in her previous form. I clasp my newly prehensile feet together, locking Sloane in place.</p>
<p>I kiss em greedily, my nose bumping against eir featureless face.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨Anything else?⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨Obviously.⟩</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>The tendril in my solar plexus pulls out and an involuntary shiver goes through me.</p>
<p>My hands tour down eir body; I stroke from eir neack to eir breasts while my other hands move from eir breasts down eir waist, one goes around eir back for leverage, the other down eir front, between eir legs where I find a thick cock. I wrap my thumbs around it and stroke languidly, pulling eir foreskin back.</p>
<p>As I do, my fingers brush against another shaft, and I turn my manual attention to eir second cock, taking my hands off eir tits, one to grasp eir neck, and the other to attend to the now bereft first cock. Just to make sure, I grope beneath the second one, and find a smooth scrotum with three plump balls in. I give that a fondle, and return to doubly stroking Sloane’s cocks.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨You’re on the take for cock, you know that?⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨Five on the kinsey scale and proudly marrying femme.⟩</span></em></p>
</div>
<p>E probes my sex with a tendril with soft fingers, and I let em find an inviting cunt. Playfully e begins massaging my clit, and I’m actuely reminded that I have no idea what my new body is capable of.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨Kinsey sucks — there’s no accounting for nonbinary genders.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨And it isn’t even self-descriptive, but was originally formulated as a scientific rating of the intesity of sexual response to stimuli, yeah.⟩</span><br />
⟨What did I ever do to deserve you?⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>The pleasure is <em>intense.</em> In a way that none of the other amazing sex acts have been, this simple fingering leaves me scrabbling for purchase on the walls with my free hands, and I’m nowhere close to an orgasm. And not only that, but I feel every contour and topology of eir appendage with the same level of detail as if with my hand or tongue.</p>
<p>The sensation sparks a need of such magnitude that I can neither name nor describe nor poetically approach it, for cock. Sloane’s in particular, but at this point I’ve basically got a craving.</p>
<div class="mo center">
<p><em>⟨Ask me what you</em> can <em>do. The answer is self-evident.</em> 😆<em>⟩<br />
<span class="slo">⟨Hold on tight.⟩</span><br />
⟨With twenty-four fingers, honey.⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>Sloane gyrates forward, needing no guidance because who in the world would have cocks that aren’t fully dexterous. Two well-lubricated cockheads push gently against my inviting sex and tight ring. As my cunt lips part; as I relax my ring, I get treated to the sensation of eir smooth, wide glans, followed by the spiny lumps on the coronas, and then the smooth shafts entering.</p>
<p>The tingling of nuclear fusion between us in my mind solidifies into a film of icy-white fire inside my cunt.</p>
<p>I gasp as e pushes forward and bottoms out, eir mound meeting mine. My hand on eir neck goes into eir hair, meeting the base of the eye-stalks on the back of eir head. I unclasp my feet and instead grab hold of the base of eir tail with both feet, allowing me two find eir buttocks. As e pulls back out, I find my clitoris and polish it like the world is going to end.</p>
<p>Which it might as well have, as Sloane thrusts into me again.</p>
<p>And this is where e unveils — perhaps accidentally — a second, greater use of our telepathic bond. This time, I feel eir sensation of plunging into my hot depths; not only how my perfect sheath and ass clamp down on eir cocks, but the tremendous influx of nourishing energy. A broken dam of stellar-core plasma, through every square hairs-breath of eir cocks.</p>
<div class="mo center">
<p><em>⟨Is this what it feels like?⟩</em><br />
<span class="slo"><em>⟨Yes and no. This intensity is new, oh my</em> fuck <em>this is amazing.⟩</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>Eir hand-paws grasp my shoulders — both sets, and eir feet steady against the curving transition from floor to wall, as e begins pumping hard and fast, I send my own sensation back to em, of eir every vein and barb against the inside of my cunt and ass.</p>
<p>Sloane moans into our kiss.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨Horizon, I love you.⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>I lean into the sensation again, <em>pushing</em> my love and desire into em, and at once Sloane tenses, and on the next pump, e comes, pumping my cunt and ass full of icy-hot nectar. Load after load, one with each thrust.</p>
<div class="mo center">
<p><em>⟨I love you too; don’t stop.⟩</em></p>
</div>
<p>Eir orgasm abades, and mine begins to build. I let down on the <em>push</em> that led em there.</p>
<div class="slo center">
<p><em>⟨How are you doing that?⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨I just_ push _into the sensation. What is it?⟩</span><br />
⟨Erosynthesis.⟩<br />
<span class="mo">⟨I felt it through you, but not when I pushed?⟩</span><br />
⟨My fault. I’ll do better next time, now that I know it’s coming.⟩</em></p>
