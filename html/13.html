<h1 class="title">chapter 13</h1>
</header>
<p>I come to, and I’m submerged in thick gloop, a clear membrane between me and fresh air. My immediate panic is quelled somewhat by recognizing the taste as stale nectar. The viscous fluid and membrane blurs my vision, but I can see Sloane outside, on the floor, sitting with eir knees up to eir chin.</p>
<p>Eir loneliness is overpowering — I can feel eir dissociating from in here.</p>
<p>With a hand, I push against the membrane, and find it too pliable and durable to rip. I extend my claws and slice it to ribbons. The gelatinous nectar falls out in chunks, and I barely keep my balance as I step out.</p>
<p>My lungs are full of goop, so I draw a breath down my posterior trachea and forcefully ventilate them, expelling a modest shower of fluid, while I heave over forwards. I draw a second breath, and alternate closing my nostrils, clearing my nasal cavity. I swallow what’s in my mouth. The third breath gives me an olfactory overview of the room, while I contract my ear canals to squeeze the goop out.</p>
<p>My soles change texture to give me grip as I walk across the slippery lotus leaf and onto the slippery bathroom floor, and in three strides I reach Sloane, scooping eir diminutive body up in my arms.</p>
<p>«Hey, babe,» I say.</p>
<p>E doesn’t respond. I put eir face over my shoulder — much like I once did my son — and turn around to look at the lotus. It is crumbling, gradually turning to ash. In my arms, Sloane is almost entirely coated in the purple velvety worm skin, with only eir face white, and a tuft of red hair on eir scalp. A row of tendrils hang limply from eir back.</p>
<p>Intense loneliness emanates from eir mind.</p>
<p>«Clemency, please. It’s me, your Horizon.»</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>…</p>
</div>
<p><em>Babe.</em></p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>I— I— I— I— I— I— …</em></p>
</div>
<p>I shudder. Something went <em>really</em> wrong.</p>
<p>I look down at my hand, retracing the last few seconds. It finally sinks in that whatever e did to me, everything is wired into my brain — if I indeed still have one of those — to be as second nature as everything else. Testing, I flex my claws, examine the fact that I can breathe continuously if I inhale through my mouth and exhale through my nostrils, and I can pinch my nostrils and ear canals closed.</p>
<p>And — «I know Infernal now.» Literally, <em>star-heart-utterance-serial.</em></p>
<p>I pat Sloane on the head. «I’ll figure something out, Clemency.» I kiss eir neck, and project my love into it, full force.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>Yum.</em></p>
</div>
<p>There’s a tiny retort from em, a tiny curling of eir tendrils, but e remains unresponsive.</p>
<p>We’re a long way from the <em>Gehenna,</em> and I have a feeling I need to get back there to fix this: either this is the first time it has happened, and I need the Captain’s resources and experience with Sloane — as detestable as that prospect is; or it has happened before and someone will know how to fix it. Failing both, I’ll have to figure out what is wrong, while working with a newly-rearranged body and mind.</p>
<p>I stride — my gait is lighter and quicker now, my knees feel even more flexible than when nectar fixed the too-short tendons on the back of my legs — into the bedroom, and gently set Sloane down on the bed. Thankfully e can sit by emself.</p>
<p>Quickly, I throw on a pair of hotpants, running shoes with separate big-toes, and a top. I discover that I’m devoid of external genitalia, and — to some relief that I can summon forth whatever I need from my pelvic area.</p>
<p>My torso is also androgynous, but shifts both bone structure and apparent fat distribution with but a thought. My limbs are powerful, filled with corded muscle in unfamiliar configurations. There’s a socket in my solar plexus, and all my joints bear literal joins in the skin — as if my skin can come off in segments, which it probably can.</p>
<p>There’s also no trace of my tattoos or jewelry, and I realize another modality is lurking in the back of my mind. Chromatophores open and my skin bloom in unstructured chaotic colors. A few seconds of focus is all I need to tile my left arm with hexagons, sleeve my right in flowers, put the wings back on my calves — and that is when I discover that my skin can grow hair and scales and feathers as I please; so I make the pinions actual feathers — and my spine on my back. I can actually <em>feel</em> my skeleton, so replicating my spine is easy. It is also not a human spine anymore, and my skin can turn into hard carapace too, so I make a line of spine-shaped plates instead.</p>
<p>I put the wind rose on my belly, and an enneagram wreathed in blue flame over my heart. To my delight, I can imbue motion in them, and let it persist. I set my hexagons to slowly and asynchronously fade from black to skin and back, my flowers to drift in Brownian patterns and the flames to languidly flicker.</p>
<p>The whole process takes <em>seconds</em>; it’s not like I spend a dozen minutes goofing off while my lover is in peril.</p>
<p>I sling Sloane’s bag over my shoulder, then my holster bag on my thigh, and pull a long scarf from it. I pick up Sloane and strap em to my back like another infant, and then I am out the door.</p>
<p>Rather than taking the stairs, I identify a window facing the street and take a plunge; the wind catches me gently and I enter the lobby through the front door.</p>
<p>«Hello, what can I do for you?» the bartender asks. He has put on a flowing red shirt with elaborate fractals in darker shades seemingly tie-dyed into it.</p>
<p>«My partner and I are checking out early.» I slide the keys across the counter.</p>
<p>«Ah, any reason why? Complaints?»</p>
<p>«An accident of magical nature; I need to return to our ship post-haste. Uh— there might be some thorough cleaning necessary in the bathroom.»</p>
<p>«Of course, I see. My condolences about the accident, and best wishes on eir recovery. Regarding the cleaning service, your advance-payment should cover anything short of re-tiling the place.»</p>
<p>«Thank you. What’s the quickest way of getting to the mooring towers?»</p>
<p>He looks at me for a moment. «Ah, of course, I assume you cannot Dreamwalk?»</p>
<p>I tilt my head ‘no.’</p>
<p>«There’s a transport agency down the street, they can get you to the mooring district in thirsy bells .»</p>
<p>Thirsy bells. It takes me no mental conversion to grasp it — that said, it comes out to thirty-nine hours less six minutes. That’s too long. I don’t even entirely know what the mooring tower is even called. At least now I can ask.</p>
<p>“Can I even— yeah okay, English is still there. <em>Svenska också,</em>” I mutter to myself.</p>
<p>«Thank you for your help,» I say.</p>
<p>«Venus’ love be with you.»</p>
<p>«And with you,» I reply.</p>
<p>I leave through the lobby doors, and try to think of what to do next. Sloane was terrifyingly fast if flying here took ten minutes or so, while the return trip with what I assume is public transport of some sort takes days. The obvious thing to do is to board whatever vehicle it is and think of the way.</p>
<p>Scouting up and down the street, I adjust my vision zoom to pick off the writing on the signs — I climb a lamp post to better read the far-off ones over the crowd, and feel in my distal phalanges the electrical fields of the cables inside it as I hang from it. It draws a few stares, not of derision or confusion, but of merriment.</p>
<p>As soon as I spot the agency, I jump down and make my way through the sparse crowd at a run. My pulse barely rises — I also notice it runs on a three-step cycle somehow — and my breathing remains unlabored. I feel the electrical landscape of the entire street as I run. I get there in a half ges.</p>
<p>To my horror, it’s some kind of sightseeing tours. I step in, and cast about for a map, which I find in the shape of a folder. The route from here goes fairly directly to the mooring district, but still not optimal. The room itself is an arrangement of futons — no counter, no cash registry, nothing to indicate it is a business.</p>
<p>«What can I do for you?»</p>
<p>I turn to the clerk, who seems to be a middle-aged, short pudgy woman with green-tinted skin. She’s nude, save for a bandoleer that seems to be made of coin purses, and she is setting up her messy grey hair. A trickle of sweat runs down her temple.</p>
<p>«Right, uh, I need a ride to the mooring district; I’m new here and I can’t Dreamwalk,» I say.</p>
<p>«Oh, of course. The next departure is in five ges.»</p>
<p>They have airships, of course. Not blimps or zeppelins, but literal keel-and-deck ships that just inexplicably float; like a blimp’s gondola without the balloon. «How fast are your ships?»</p>
<p>«Cruise at thirsy leagues per watch,» she replies.</p>
<p>‹Leagues,› <em>beru.</em> Ten kilometers and change. Which would put the distance to the mooring district at something like two thousand klicks, meaning Sloane flew Mach 10 at <em>least</em>.</p>
<p>«How much?»</p>
<p>«A dozen shekels.»</p>
<p>I dig through Sloane’s bag, feeling slightly guilty, and find eir money purse. A gilded coin I’m familiar with — having spent a <em>lot</em> of them on my sugar-parent-sponsored shopping spree — finds its way into her hand. She puts it in a pocket.</p>
<p>She hums. «Roof access,» she says and points to a door. Then she spins on one heel, and I see her undo her hair bun, and as she passes through the door to the back room, she discards the bandoleer. Shortly after I loose sight of her, I hear a loud slap and a drawn out moan.</p>
<p>Because of course.</p>
<p>Heading for the roof, I take the steps two at a time, and reach the door in short order, opening it to a windswept surface of concrete with a mooring tower in the middle.</p>
<p>I sit cross-legged on the bare rooftop, set Sloane down in my lap, and begin rummaging through eir duffel bag. Surely there’s something in there — the Gehenna has got several one-ups on the <em>Enterprise,</em> if they don’t have a transporter — which I know for a fact is possible, since teleportation agencies exist — I’m buying myself a hat and eating it.</p>
<p>When I concentrate on retrieving an ‹emergency beacon,› I get a little elder wood stick. An inscription along the length of it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sloane emergency return beacon   break here →|← break here.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I scramble for some paper in eir bag, and scribble a quick message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Sloane remade my body and something went wrong, sending em ahead for medical(?) attention.</em></p>
<p><em>Stuck out here with slower transportation.</em></p>
<p>— <em>Morgan</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folding the message into a tiny piece, I grab a roll of tape from eir bag as well — e has most of six toolboxes in there by my reckoning — and tape it to eir chest. Then I put eir little hands around the ends of the stick and snap it in half.</p>
<p>There’s a heartbeat when I think it might have gone wrong, and then in between one video frame and the next, my arms are empty.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p><em>Wait.</em></p>
</div>
<p>I hug myself and a sob escapes me. It’s awful to be away from em. It’s awful not to know if e will be okay. It’s awful because it has happened before. An image of Quentin’s battered face, intubated in a hospital bed, flashes before my minds eye.</p>
<p>Panic rises, but I force it down.</p>
<p>I spot the incoming ship in the distance. The wait is handily enough time for me to get myself under control. All I can do is hope I’ve done the right thing.</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship arrives, briefly hooks the mooring tower with a clawed robot arm and I board it by a rope ladder. It is the size of a galley ship, and make for a strange amalgamate of wooden decks and hull and high tech components like what appears to be turboprop engines that somehow run silently. The passengers populate the weather deck for sight seeing and enjoying the sun, and the first lower deck with seating.</p>
<p>I cast a glance towards the ever-so-slightly blue-tinted gigantic array of mile-high mooring towers two hundred leagues in the distance, and impatience and trepidation claws at my chest.</p>
<p>Going below deck, I find a nice seat in a distant corner and try to read, only to find I can’t muster the attention for it. Instead I go thought Sloane’s bag in search of a communication device.</p>
<p>What I find instead is a notebook in Sloane’s handwriting. I page through it and find a note of ‹Gehenna’s hailing pattern: <span class="purple">purple</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> <span class="red">red</span> <span class="yellow">yellow</span> <span class="blue">blue</span> <span class="green">green</span> <span class="red">red</span>.›</p>
<p>This leads me to pick up the <em>Sorcery Handbook and Introduction with Primer on Porting Ink, 14th Edition</em> I’ve been carrying around since two days ago, without even being able to read the title. I look up ‘hailing’ without reading the introductory chapters, and then when I comprehend absolutely nothing, I grudgingly go back and read the introduction.</p>
<p>The gist of it is this: Sorcery is the art of tricking the universe into thinking something ought to happen. The number of footnotes necessary to explain that sentence in detail is greater than the number of words in it.</p>
<p>Apparently, I need to read up on <em>Dreaming</em> first, to really understand the true nature of sorcery, but the theory is not tantamount to the development of practical applications.</p>
<p>The “tricking” part is really the only important part, and it is done via symbolism — both collective and individual, established and improvised.</p>
<p>I pause when understanding finally manifests. It is a world that works the way you think it ought to work. That’s <em>exceedingly</em> convenient.</p>
<p>Hailing is done, not by some identification scheme and magical radio, but by giving the hailer a clear enough picture of the vessel hailed. The color codes are not unique, but merely serve to help specify.</p>
<p>The simplest, bluntest method is to use a pentagram, draw up the color code and identifying characteristics, and write the intended message, both in porting ink. Almost all ships will have receivers set up to receive such messages, crude as they are. I idly wonder if I can conjure a pentagram on my skin and use that; there’s a bottle of porting ink in Sloane’s bag.</p>
<p>«Hello.»</p>
<p>I look up. Somehow, someone has gotten the drop on me, despite my enhanced senses.</p>
<p>It’s a woman in a rather curve hugging, buttoned-up trench coat, which I am almost certain hides lingerie, rather than any actual clothes, while accentuating her ridiculous hour-glass figure. Her legs are covered in striking black thigh-high boots with six inch heels. On her head is a bowler hat. Her skin is — I shit you not — piebald. Whether from vitiligo or nectar-realized farm animal fetishism, I cannot tell. Her facial features are sharp, but kind.</p>
<p>She’s human, albeit with fur-tipped ears and whiskers, but I get the feeling there’s a succubus hiding somewhere on her person.</p>
<p>«Salutations,» I say. «I’m reading.» I hold up the book for emphasis.</p>
<p>She continues in her raspy voice: «yes you are. You also have the mannerisms of a <em>whale-out-of-water</em>, you’re obviously both lonely and sad, and you’re researching how to contact ships. This leads me to believe you’re without your companion(s), and from either an isolated Prey World, or a Lost World. You’re on this trip, which pointedly goes towards the harbor district, which with your research leads me to assume that’s where your companion(s) reside(s).»</p>
<p>I look up at her. «Am I supposed to be impressed?»</p>
<p>She falters a little, her smug smile vanishing. «Sorry; I’ve accumulated some unbecoming habits. I’d like to help,» she says. «We’re passing near Valhalla soon, and I’ve got some contacts there who can get you just about anywhere in an eyeblink.»</p>
<p>I tense a little. «I would appreciate that. What do I owe you?»</p>
<p>She giggles. «Helping people is its own reward. Seriously, no need to be tense; you’re not in danger here in Pandemonium — not ever.»</p>
<p>I nod — actually the gesture for assent among speakers of Infernal is more of a raising of the chin than a lowering.</p>
<p>«The only thing I cannot place is: you don’t look very human.» She crosses her legs, and I get the distinct impression her <em>clothes</em> are a succubus of some sort.</p>
<p>«My companion, succubus I incubated, is a wellspring — is that what it’s called? — and I have a… Let’s call it ‹a thing for body modification› which led to what you’re seeing,» I explain. It’s a half-truth.</p>
<p>She nods anyway. «You’ve got good eyes.»</p>
<p>«Pardon?» I ask.</p>
<p>«I’m Cordeza.»</p>
<p>«Morgan,» I offer.</p>
<p>«Morgan,» she says. «Meet Boots.»</p>
<p>Her boots grow several mouths, with human — or perhaps horse-like — teeth. «<em>Hello,</em>» they sing in six melodious voices.</p>
<p>I draw a complete blank at what to say next.</p>
<hr />
<p>Boots is indeed Cordeza’s succubus, a second-tier shapeshifter. She’s an amputee and Boots is her sapient prosthetics and partner in both sex and crime — for a definition of crime that amounts to seduction and subsequent threesomes.</p>
<p>After about a half-watch, which I mostly spend reading, while she enjoys some <em>incredibly</em> subtle and well disguised sexual attention from Boots — which strangely doesn’t bother me as much as I expected, to have someone literally have sex in the seat next to me. I pretend not to notice, as Cordeza pretends to not be pleasured. A social fiction. It’s probably a kink of hers, really.</p>
<p>I miss Sloane.</p>
<p>«We’re here,» Cordeza says eventually, and I snap closed the sorcery introduction, stowing it in my holster bag.</p>
<p>She leads the way to the aft deck above, and takes a plunge into the sky below — we’ve gained a lot of elevation. Unflinchingly, I step onto the railing after her, and let myself fall. I’ve stowed Sloane’s bag inside my own, because why should there be an interdict against extra-spatial storage inside extra-spatial storage?</p>
<p>Angling myself to follow, I go into a dive to catch up. A nictitating membrane slides over my eyes to protect them against the wind — what little they need protecting, given the Gift of Air. I catch up to Cordeza, who falls in a classic skydiver’s pose, and slow down best as I can, which given my aerodynamic outfit is not as much as she can in her coat.</p>
<p>It’s of little matter, because the ground rushes up to meet us, and we land safely in a broad, crowded street, flanked in brutalist architecture. I look to Cordeza, and she points to the building across the street and building one over.</p>
<p>Even with the surrounding street looking like something out of a cyberpunk novel, this one stands out. Black facade, twelve stories tall, glass, steel, painted concrete, irregular segments slowly moving in between one another.</p>
<p>Cordeza sets out towards it, and I follow. The entrance is a gigantic transparent gate. I note as we pass it that it translates the light too much to have an index of refraction comparable to glass. To my delight, I can do arithmetic and remember numbers with ridiculous ease, and I run a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate its index to be almost 2.5.</p>
<p>Diamond? Two cubit thick gates of flawless diamond.</p>
<p>The lobby beyond has every wall and ceiling surface gilded. We encounter a succubus twice as tall as myself, grey-skinned, with massive horns, and wearing an immaculate suit.</p>
<p>«Hello Ferdinand,» Cordeza says. «Myself and one guest.»</p>
<p>Ferdinand turns his gaze to me, and addresses me in a rumbling voice. «Is the guest armed?»</p>
<p>«Uh… I—I’ve got some tools—» I stammer.</p>
<p>He smiles and gestures to the side where a section of wall slides aside. «Compliments of Valhalla, avail yourself of our curated armory, but do please only take one or two.»</p>
<p>What is revealed is a wall full of of instruments of death, not unlike what you might see in a cheesy action flick. There’s a dozen rifles of different makes, an array of hand guns ranging from futuristic to black-powder revolvers, and of course, a rack of mêlée weapons, everything from cudgels to <em>Zweihanders</em>.</p>
<p>I pick a slick and futuristic-looking small-caliber pistol in a stylish back holster and a narrow stiletto knife with a cute sheath. I set the gun holster against my sacrum in the hip-strap of my bag of holding, and the sheath in the same, hanging in front of my pubic bone.</p>
<p>«Swell choices; they are yours to keep if you wish,» Ferdinand rumbles.</p>
<p>Cordeza takes me to a utilitarian-looking elevator, and we ride to the tenth floor.</p>
<p>«Are you armed?» I ask. To which she replies by lifting up her foot, to show the heel of Boots morphing into first a wicked claw, then the barrel of a gun.</p>
<p>We reach our destination, and exit into another gilded hallway, although more low-light than the lobby. Cordeza leads me down past numbered doors, until we reach a specific one, and pushes it open without knocking.</p>
<p>The room beyond is an office, decorated in minimalist style — big windows with no curtains, white walls, white floors, black cabinets, and with a massive glossy black desk, behind which sits a man.</p>
<p>A man with the head of a lion, and a dark-skinned bare torso built from barely-contained athleticism.</p>
<p>«Cordeza, what can I do for you?» he asks in a smooth baritone.</p>
<p>«Mustafa, I figured I’d find you here. This here fellow has need of your Dreamwalking abilities.» She gestures to me.</p>
<p>Mustafa purrs, and from under the table appears the face of another handsome man — bald, even darker skin, with heavy gold earrings, and a narrow face with intimidating features. He moves out from his hiding place, revealing himself to be four-armed, clad only in bangles and piercings, and possessing a snake’s body below the belt — dark green and brown scales interlaced in intricate patterns.</p>
<p>Mustafa zips up his pants and stands, revealing himself to be clad in stonewashed jeans with a <em>prominent</em> bulge, and nothing else. He turns to the snake man and says something in a language I don’t understand — but which sounds suspiciously like a dialect of Infernal.</p>
<p>«All right,» he says to me. «I owe Cordeza about a million favors, so let’s tick off one of those. Where can I take you?»</p>
<p>«It’s one of the mooring towers, I don’t know which. It’s a ship called the Gehenna, black, sleek, white markings, large turbine engines, delta wings, hailing code purple, blue, red, yellow, blue, green, red,» I reply.</p>
<p>Mustafa looks to Cordeza. «Damn if that isn’t specific as hell.» He turns to the other man. «What do you make of it?»</p>
<p>«There’s <span title="6⁴ = 1296">unexians</span> of ships in the mooring district. I’m going to need to narrow that down,» he says.</p>
<p>He looks at me for a long moment, two hands on his hips, his. «Have you visited the pier this ship is moored at before?»</p>
<p>«Yes.»</p>
<p>«Let’s regress you, and you can read the sign on the pier.»</p>
<p>«Like hypnosis?» I ask. «Does it work if I didn’t know Infernal when I was there?»</p>
<p>He shakes his head — it’s a rolling motion from side to side. «Don’t worry, I have other ways.»</p>
<p>«Why not just hail them?» Cordeza asks.</p>
<p>«Because it’s boring and a waste of my abilities,» he replies.</p>
<p>He opens a drawer and sets on the table an inkstone, a brush, a pitcher of clear oil — I can tell by the scent, and a stick of white ink. In short order he prepares a suitable amount of ink, and wields the inkstone in one hand and brushes in three others. He draws directly on the smooth tabletop for what seems like a mesmerizing eternity, but my mental timekeeping tells me is very briefly, and <em>very</em> fast.</p>
<p>Last, he takes a small glass inkwell that seems to be full of a window to the night sky, cleans his brushes by sucking the ink off, and then dips all three and takes a second pass over it, placing single droplets in the still-wet white ink.</p>
<p>«Bear with me for a moment,» he says, turning to me. «What is your name?»</p>
<p>«Morgan,» I say.</p>
<p>«I am Huzia. Please, join me.» His voice is sonorous and pleasant.</p>
<p>I move over to the table, next to him. From here, the pattern is… Strange. Shifting; as if made of optical illusions, even though I might not be susceptible to those anymore. Dizzying, almost. Vertigo-inducing.</p>
<p>«<em>Behold,</em>» Huzia hisses in my ear, and his hand taps the back of my head.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Gehenna is docked, hanging paradoxically in mid-air, tethered by the nose of the craft, with panels slid away to reveal the corridor leading to the lounge. The landing beyond is as busy as it was a few days ago.</p>
<p>I see Ramaeshwara further down the pier, conversing with some uniform-clad folk, next to several crates and containers.</p>
<hr />
<p>I blink. I’m back in the minimalist office.</p>
<p>«It’s moored to <em>Lacrimal Delights</em> at level <span title="87">two nif dozen-three</span>, pier nine,» Huzia says beside me.</p>
<p>Mustafa laughs a hearty laugh. «Oh, I know where that is.» He steps over to me, and puts a hand on my shoulder. If I wasn’t so worried about Sloane, I might give it an earnest thought that I’m flanked my enormous, attractive men.</p>
<p>«Permission to pick you up?» Mustafa asks.</p>
<p>«Go ahead,» I say.</p>
<p>Gently, he lifts me in a bridal carry.</p>
<p>«In a second, you’re gonna feel like the entire universe is just you and me — try not to freak out.»</p>
