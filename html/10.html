<h1 class="title">chapter 10</h1>
</header>
<p>It’s a beautiful and sunny day.</p>
<p>The wandering stars have names and time-tables and hidden natures and it’s all locked away behind the impenetrability of Infernal, inside the pristine almanac in my holster bag of holding. This nagging fact sit in the back of my mind as I go over language exercises, sitting in one of Themiscyra’s many, many parks.</p>
<p>The grass is so soft that if the whole city was nothing but, you’d never need shoes. Indeed the cobbles paving the streets are so smooth that footwear is 90% fashion.</p>
<p>«<span title="30/36">Fifsy pernif</span>.» I say. They don’t use percent here.</p>
<p>The number system is seximal. ‹One›, ‹two›, ‹three›, ‹four›, ‹five›, ‹six›, ‹twelve›, ‹<span title="18">thirsy</span>›, ‹<span title="24">forsy</span>›, ‹<span title="30">fifsy</span>›, ‹<span title="36">nif</span>›, ‹<span title="72">two nif</span>›, and so on, up to ‹<span title="216">six nif</span>›.</p>
<p>A ‹<span title="1/36">pernif</span>› is the chance of rolling snake eyes on two dice; one in thirty-six.</p>
<p>Cubits, hands, and fingers, not feet and inches or metres. I’m three cubits three hands and two fingers tall.</p>
<p>Graves, not pounds or kilograms. Roughly two pounds; or roughly a kilogram to a grave. I’m <span title="85">two nif dozen-one</span> graves. Or at least I was last time I had access to a scale.</p>
<p>An absu is three-nif dozen cubits. A ges is <span title="252">seven nif</span> heartbeats, a watch is <span title="32">fifsy-two</span> ges; which comes out to just over eight thousand seconds, which is two hours, fourteen minutes, and twenty-four seconds. Those a nautical units, though. Regular people use moments which are <span title="216">six nif</span> heartbeats, and bells which are <span title="72">two nif</span> moments; which comes out to four hours, nineteen minutes, and twelve seconds.</p>
<p>Accusative form of «house». Ergative form of «house». Past indicative of «enjoy». Precent particible of «fuck». Flash card. Flash card. Flash card. «I must master Infernal,» I mutter.</p>
<p>Sloane is lying in the grass next to me, reading the <em>Kama Sutra</em> still. E has grown <em>leaves</em> — the green kind, but probably not capable of photosynthesis; as far as I know, for nothing other than kicks.</p>
<p>I snap shut the textbook and pocket my flash cards. I roll my shoulders — only a quarter as sore as they usually are; my back creaks nicely as I stretch.</p>
<p>“I wanna get my ears pierced.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I look up. “You already have?”</p>
<p>E has two very noticeable rings hanging by eir earlobes.</p>
</div>
<p>“Yeah, <em>once.</em> I need like, <em>six</em> in <em>each.</em> Maybe a septum too. Do they have tattoo parlours here?” I scan the crowd for signs of someone with ink.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yeah, skin painting is a thing.”</p>
</div>
<p>I roll to my feet and brush the grass off my butt. “Can succubi get drunk?” I ask. “We should go to a party tonight.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Not off liquor. Didn’t you have problems with alcohol?” I ask.</p>
</div>
<p>I shrug. “Yeah. Yeah I did. Maybe I still do. Do you think it’s a bad idea?” I feel like a teenager again. Impulsive, full of love and wonder. I look down at Sloane, lying with the book open against eir chest.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“There’s no such thing as a bad idea if you’re having fun while fucking up.”</p>
</div>
<p>Eir leaves furl away, retracting like a time-lapse of a plant sprouting, played in reverse. E rises with impossible ease and grace, never moving the book from eir chest. A tendril from eir back picks up eir duffel, and the book goes away.</p>
<p>E looks at me, and I stand on my toes to kiss eir lips. My white-and-black crimson-eyed demigoddess. Eir feelers run over my bald head, and we intertwine our fingers.</p>
<hr />
<p>We walk down a broad promenade, paved with stone and lined with all manners of cultivated plants and artful installations — some of them are even probably street lamps. It reminds me of the beaches of California which I’ve never seen except on a screen.</p>
<p>As far as the eye can see, every style of architecture conceivable is represented, from <em>Art Deco</em> to <em>Art Nouveau</em>; from <em>Baroque</em> to <em>Brutalism</em>. Strange cobbled-together slum apartments reminiscent of the walled city of Kowloon flowing into dense ordered streets like downtown <em>Lyon</em>. There’s no beach, you see, just a cliff drop of perhaps three cords or so.</p>
<p>The pedestrians are variously dressed in high fashions, flowing pastels, jewellery only, or just nude. Forms are biased towards human, but as always, every dreamed-up sexual fantasy is plainly represented.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“You know tattoos aren’t permanent right?” I ask. “I’ve had several, some of them magical.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Wh— oh, right. Nectar.” My shoulders slump a little.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>That’s an unusually strong disappointment. “You seemed strangely upbeat about it — did you actually <em>want</em> a permanent skinpainting?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Maybe?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“You know… Let’s ask someone who’s in the know.”</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>«Well, depends.»</p>
<p>Evidently, either tattoos <em>can</em> be permanent, or this girl is <em>really</em> into needles. Tattoo/piercing parlors exist, of course, and finding one proved fairly easy.</p>
<p>It’s a seedy little hole in the wall — because who needs hygiene when you have nectar — and the proprietor looks like every other tattoo/piercing-parlor owner I have ever seen; she likes her own product. She’s human, tall, bald, and her skin is a deep dramatic black; her ink is writes and greys and greens and yellows and pastels, in floral and abstract shapes, and she carries maybe forsy piercings for all the world to see. Including nipples, navel, and a couple below the belt that my own inhibitions makes me unable to study too closely.</p>
<p>Incidentally the infernal word for tattoo is literally composed of the morphemes «skin» and «paint», while piercings are «needle» and «jewel».</p>
<p>«Not ‘no’» I echo.</p>
<p>«Correct; needlejewels and skinpaint are as permanent as anything else. If you truly <em>want</em> them, they will stay.»</p>
<p>“I didn’t catch all of that?” I ask Sloane. E translates.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«So for instance if <em>I</em> wield the needle, it might stick for longer?»</p>
</div>
<p>«If that is the nature of your relationship, maybe.»</p>
<p>“What?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“She’s saying it could work. It depends on what your innermost desires are.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Of course it does.” «You sell color?» I ask.</p>
<p>«If I sell my inks?»</p>
<hr />
<div class="slo">
<p>We settle in on a nice little flat rooftop of light concrete, beset with benches and tables and raised bed gardening. At Morgan’s direction, we’ve purchased vials of ink in black, white, blue, yellow, green, and red.</p>
<p>“So, what’s your plan?” I ask.</p>
</div>
<p>“Are you any good at art?” I ask. “Like, drawing, painting?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Not really? I mean, I can sketch a little, make technical diagrams.”</p>
</div>
<p>I nod, thoughtfully. “Okay, here’s a wild idea. You can shapeshift into complex mechanisms; do you think you can make a tattoo needle?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I furrow my brow. “Never tried that before.” With a thought, a tendril springs from my back and forms into a hollow needle, connected to a gland-like reservoir of nectar, and guided by a delicate structure of muscle that can vibrate it with great force.</p>
<p>Like clenching fingers, I activate it and it buzzes faintly, the little needle moving like a blur.</p>
</div>
<p>I nod, smiling with satisfaction. “No surprise there, <em>jetplane.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I grab the phials of color, and manifest five more glands and needles. Little straws dart from the ink reservoirs into the phials, and drink up their contents. The thin ballooning tissue is translucent enough to show the color through easily.</p>
<p>Taking a hold of my tattoo gun with a hand, I look at Morgan.</p>
<p>“Test?” I ask and get a nod in return.</p>
<p>I put the needle to eir cheek. The kinetic feedback is novel, but I get a handle on it quickly enough.</p>
</div>
<p>“What are you putting on me?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“A little heart. If you don’t like it, it’ll fade.”</p>
</div>
<p>A minute of prickling discomfort later, Sloane holds up a mirrored palm and I see a little blue heart, the size of my pinky finger nail. It sits on my cheek, artfully below my eye, like a fake beauty mark. “I like it.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I smile, basking in eir subtle satisfaction. “And that’s just the beginning.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Do you think you could see yourself as my personal skinpainter?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I can see myself as <em>yours,</em> babe.” I Lean in and we kiss, a deep, slow kiss.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>After confirming that Sloane’s artistic abilities are not up to snuff for making the full sleeves I have always dreamt of, I let ideas churn in the back of my mind while we turn our attention to needle-jewelry.</p>
<p>Making piercings is trivially easy. What I want is steel rings. Plain, simple, universal, aesthetic, and pleasantly heavy.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“If I may?”</p>
<p>I nibble Morgan’s earlobe, and deftly remove the ring already there with my tongue. I rest my cheekbone against eirs and use bone conduction to say: “<em>You’re gonna feel a little prick.</em>”</p>
<p>Testing, I stick a thin tendril from my tongue through eir existing hole, and form it into a ring before transmuting it into a steel ring — with no clasp or opening. Once that has been done, I ready another tendril, this one with a sharpened tip, and jam it through eir earlobe next to the first.</p>
<p>Morgan gives a little hiss of pain; eir hand squeezes mine.</p>
</div>
<p>“Ow.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I curl around and transmute another steel ring. My saliva-nectar ensures immediate healing.</p>
<p>“<em>Four more to go on this ear.</em>”</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>Twelve in the ears, and one centered on my lower lip; matching steel bracelets, so tight I can’t take them off without dislocating my thumb, and anklets and a choker I simply can’t take off.</p>
<p>Septum didn’t take — the part of that ring going through my flesh simply disintegrated and the whole thing fell off — but both wings of my nose took rings willingly, as did my eyebrows take three rings each, and a stud through either cheek.</p>
<p>I admire my new look in Sloane’s reflective palm. Sadly the little blue heart is already gone. “Can you to split my tongue?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>My hand goes behind eir neck, and I pull em in form a kiss. My own tongue becomes a set of tendrils with many more sharp bits than a tongue should have.</p>
<p>Morgan flinches as I pinch eir tongue, holding it tight, and positioning the wedge-shaped blades I’ve elected to use. Holding the back of eir head I <em>bite down</em>, and e yelps while the nectar numbs the pain and heals the injury.</p>
<p>I withdraw, leaving em with a mouthful of nectar.</p>
</div>
<p>“Ow. Okay that hurth. My thongue feelth funny.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Is it going away?”</p>
</div>
<p>I run my tongue over my teeth. “Doesn’t seem that way.”</p>
<hr />
<p>Part of me is a little disappointed I never got to go down on Sloane’s blue, bioluminescent cunt while it was there, but her blood red folds are just as inviting, and definitely just as tasty. Tangy, sweet, creamy, acridly acidic, caustically spicy, freezing cold, burning hot, pervasively full of perfumated aromas.</p>
<p>With my cleft tongue I can pinch eir clitoris, rolling back the clitorial hood and play directly with the exposed nub, which causes em to convulse in pleasure. Eir prehensile feet hold my shoulders and eir hands the back of my head, as I alternate between brining em to orgasm and drinking eir gushing nectar directly from eir cunt.</p>
<p>The thought hits me as. I draw back, releasing my gentle hold on eir clitoris and say: “Eureka.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I look down, panting. “Why’d you stop?”</p>
</div>
<p>“I know how you can give me tats.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I collecting my thoughts, and sit up on the bench again properly. “Pray tell?”</p>
</div>
<p>“You have tremendous control over your own body, so we just eliminate the artistic component by substituting shapeshifting. Just encase my arm in your flesh, map out the pattern by touch, and apply ink.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Left or right?”</p>
</div>
<p>I hold out my left arm.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>Sprouting a fat tendril from my back, I envelop eir entire arm from fingertip to shoulder. “What sort of motif?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Tiling hexagons.”</p>
<p>I’ve barely said it when my entire arm lights on fire, with tens of thousands of needle pricks. I grit my teeth and groan. Then before I can begin dreading it, the tendril retracts and I am left with black hexagon outlines neatly covering my entire left arm.</p>
<p>Seven of them begin at the base of my wrist, and the half-shifted next band up my arm is made of slightly larger, slightly skewed hexagons to compensate for the topology of my muscles. One hexagon neatly encircles the point of my elbow, and the top of my shoulder is adorned with a pentagon to let the hexagons follow the curvature of my body.</p>
<p>“<em>Hell yes,</em>” I say. “Now we just gotta figure out how to do flowers.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Hm. Flower shop?”</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>We end up buying a bouquet of chrysanthemums, roses, poppies, gebera daisies, amaryllis, marigolds, peonies, cockscombs, geranium, amranth, thistle, and artichoke. Sloane creates imitations of them — gaining the exact image by consuming them, no less — and then in a most artful manner reduces them to thin bas-relief representations.</p>
<p>Then e uses a layer of bioluminescent photoreceptors to essentially photo-copy the flowers into arrangements of needles and ink. E ran out of black making my sleeve and so learned to make more; and the same problem arises with the red for all the flowers.</p>
<p>By the end of an excruciating six ges, I have a flower arrangement of red and purple flowers, chaotically but pleasingly arranged on my right arm.</p>
<p>By simple geometry we make a pentagram over my heart and a 64-pointed wind rose around my navel with north pointing towards my groin. Sloane spends several ges somehow spouting flames from a circular tendril for reference, before accomplishing the artistic feat of wreathing the pentagram in photo-realistic green flames. My calves come to bear a set of beautiful wings with brown feathers, rooted at my ankles and sweeping up to my knees.</p>
<p>On my back, we undertake an ambitious project — tattooing a photo-realistic spinal column on top of my spine. Sloane’s expertise in anatomy really shines here, but it still takes a good many ges.</p>
<hr />
<p>I paint my fingernails and toe-nails light blue. I put on a spaghetti-strap beige sundress with floral print and compression shorts; tucking away my cock and balls for a flatter crotch look. I slip into a a pair of pair of utilitarian black leather boots, that go up my calves, letting the wing tips peek over.</p>
<p>I’ve gradually drifted towards a more feminine look, and today I feel comfortable pulling off the sundress, choker, and combat boots; iconic as it was back in the mid 00’s.</p>
<p>Still, something looks off in the mirror Sloane presents me with. I furrow my lip. “I need sunglasses and a lab coat — I think that’s what will complete this look.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I giggle. “I can take care of the glasses, but I am not so sure of my ability to weave.”</p>
</div>
<p>I look at my hand. “I could also use some rings. Same steel look.” I reach into my holster bag of holding for my backup frames, and hand them to Sloane. “Styled after these.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>Bold dark frames with square glass. Extruding them takes a little while, and I give the glass a mirror finish, to go with the polished steel of the frame. “Rings?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Yeah; well, I’m not much of a fashionista, but…”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“No, no it’s just — isn’t that a courtship ritual?”</p>
<p>Morgan blushes, and I laugh.</p>
</div>
<p>A rush of thoughts go through my head. “Is— is marriage a thing here?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Not as an institution, but committed relationships are quite common.”</p>
<p>Then I feel eir courage build.</p>
</div>
<p>I take a deep breath. “You know, I’ve been thinking a lot. We essentially have the rest of eternity, and we are probably going to be spending it together. Maybe it’s premature, since we’ve know each other for less than a week, but I feel like we <em>gel</em>, you know.”</p>
<p>It’s cliché, it’s gauche, it’s an appeal to masculine ideals I’ve long since shed, it’s an artifact of agricultural paleolithic society’s incentives towards gendered social differentiation, and a reflection of the resource investiture it presents to raise children.</p>
<p>I get down on one knee, and hold out my left hand while covering my heart with the right.</p>
<p>“Sloane, I love you; and I know you love me too. Will you put a ring on my finger, and spend the rest of this eternity with me?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I take eir hand, and get down on my knees. From my fingers I weave a pair of tendrils together into a loop, and slide it over eir ring finger. At the base, I harden the flesh into steel and loose connection, leaving a polished, perfect steel ring in place.</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>
</div>
<p>E pulls me in close, and on our knees, on this no-name rooftop where I’ve been baptised with body modifications, we seal this promise with a kiss. And then more than a kiss.</p>
<p>Eir hand goes under my skirt, and runs up my inner thigh, while eir tongue runs down my neck. Stong hands grab my sides, and Sloane reclines and pulls me on top of em. The only thing between me and the uncomfortably hard concrete is Sloane; and isn’t that an apt metaphor for our relationship?</p>
<p>I kiss em passionately, and taste eir nectar — chili, pepper, mint, chocolate, truffle — and my already growing erection strains against the spandex of my shorts, and eir fingers slip under the elastic lip. I plant my feet between eir legs, and lift my ass in the air, to let em take the restrictive shorts. My cock springs free, and my shorts are lightly tossed aside.</p>
<p>Falling to my knees again, straddling Sloane’s hips, the concrete is nowhere near as hard as I had feared. I gyrate my hips forward, grinding against eir cock. E takes hold of the hem of my skirt and throws it over my mast, and I see it: I’ve grown. E used to be somewhat larger than me, but now we are the same length — I know em better than to suspect e has shrunk eirs.</p>
<p>Eir feelers play under my skirt, and e pulls me down to eir chest for another kiss; eir cock finds my ring, and E bucks upwards, thrusting into me with well-lubricated ease. I push myself up, steadying myself with my hands on eir tits, as e takes hold of my hips for better leverage.</p>
<p>We make slow, passionate love in the sun. Every languid, but deeply powerful thrust grinds eir cock by my prostate, and I jerk off placidly. When orgasm finally takes us, I shoot a load that is truly impossibly big. No three spurts and a table-spoon of ejaculate, but a proper continuous jet of white come, slathering Sloane’s belly, tits, and face. My orgasm lasts a full minute, to match.</p>
<p>E spreads my come like moisturizer, and it disappears into eir skin. Nothing goes to waste.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I love you too.”</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>The rest of the day passes with reading, sight seeing, impromptu makeouts, and refreshments at street cafés. Sloane drinks a small shot of <em>straight mercury</em> and I spend thee ges asking forsy questions about psychoactive substances for succubi.</p>
<p>Themiscyra is far too big for us to be able to see all the sights; maybe if we had a year, or maybe a decade. And to be sure, people do; just wander the city, drinking it all in for decades at a time.</p>
<p>We reach the Golden Flower Vales, and Sloane checks that there’s no messages for us — e sent a telegram to the Gehenna about out accommodations. Because apparently telecommunications haven’t evolved beyond Morse code here. Maybe it doesn’t need to.</p>
<p>We reach our suite, and I draw us a bath.</p>
<p>The tub is cut from a single piece of green marble, and polished — or perhaps lacquered or even <em>glazed.</em> The water is warm, and pleasant, and we sit side by side, Sloane with eir arms along the rim and me with my head on eir shoulder.</p>
<p>I hold out my hand, with the ring on my finger. “I don’t think it ever crossed my mind to move on like this. I never imagined getting married again, at least.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I’m glad I found you.”</p>
</div>
<p>“You said Sloane is just a nickname, and if I recall correctly, that you hadn’t been <em>named.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Can I give you a name?” I look up at eir face, running my right hand over eir chest.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yes. I’d like that.”</p>
</div>
<p>«Clemency.» <em>Claighmensh.</em></p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I let it roll over my tongue. «Clemency.» “Why that?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Because you grant me clemency from the harsh realities of things like entropy, accidents of birth. You’re my ticket out. My savior. My quarter.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I like it.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Are you gonna stick with Sloane too?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I nod. “It’s a serviceable moniker.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Now that we’re getting not-married, can I take your name, then?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I laugh, and we kiss.</p>
