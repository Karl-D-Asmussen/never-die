<h1 class="title">chapter 11</h1>
</header>
<p>My muscles ache somewhat, as does my recently tattoed skin; just enough for the hot water to ease the pain in a most pleasant manner. Sloane is soft yet firm against my side.</p>
<p>Lounging in a hot tub with a succubus ought never be something that doesn’t develop into sex, but for now, our arousal is in the background.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Clemency,» I repeat. “Did you know Morgan is kinda interesting, in Infernal?”</p>
</div>
<p>“How so?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“The root morpheme ‘m-r’ means ‘sea,’ mostly.”</p>
</div>
<p>I nod. “That’s from Latin.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Which is again from Infernal. ‘Gan’ is a little harder to pin down but may derive from ‘k-n-t’ which usually means a conceptual divider.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Yeah, I looked it up once, and saw it as <em>mercant</em> with <em>cant</em> meaning ‘circle’ or ‘guard,’ and then taken to mean ‘sea chief’ but then again ‘cant’ is also a secret language, ‘to incant’ is to sing, and in Swedish it means the edge of a surface.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Horizon.» <em>Marakannito</em> “Sea-end-of-song.”</p>
</div>
<p>“That’s almost ‘significant’ in Swedish if you squint: <em>markant</em>.” I furrow my brow. “Sloane is cognate with <em>slag</em> in Swedish which means ‘kind’ or ‘a people’.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Warband.» <em>Sloghwan</em>. “Battle-host.”</p>
</div>
<p>I nod. “So, the clement horizon and the clement warband. That’s some respectable name symbolism. Would you believe I hadn’t actually researched any of this?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I giggle. “You can’t read.”</p>
</div>
<p>“— Yet!”</p>
<p>I run a hand over eir chest, into the water, down eir belly, to eir groin, and over eir flaccid cock. It twitches a little at the touch. “I think we should celebrate by fucking all night. Wanna get out of the water.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>The spike of arousal is palpable. “Why?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Because water is a terrible lubricant; I’ve <em>tried</em> tub sex. And <em>pool</em> sex. It’s… Sub par.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I titter. “You know, ’gan, sometimes you’re a damn genius — like figuring out how to make floral tattoos even though I can’t paint? That was <em>amazing.</em> Other times, you forget like <em>basic</em> things.”</p>
<p>Then I will a few hundred tendrils to form from my body, and they probe the entire volume of the tub, secreting a thick nectar-based gelating agent. Within seconds, the hundred cucubit tub is filled not with water but with a gelatinous slime.</p>
<p>Eir surprise is delightfully refreshing.</p>
<p>It’s a little known fact that viscosity of fluids is largely irrelevant when it comes to drag — at least in macroscopic situations.</p>
</div>
<p>I run my hand through the thick fluid. “You turned the entire bathtub into lube,” I say, slightly stunned. I stick a finger in my mouth. It tastes like cream filling and chili-chocolate mousse and mint foam; nutmeg and mace and pepper and cinnamon and cumin and caraway. “<em>Nectar</em> lube.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I smile slyly. “Still think we should get out?”</p>
</div>
<p>“No, but now I am wondering why you <em>stopped.</em>” I swing a leg over em and take our hardening cocks together in hand. “<em>Just a moment ago, this tub was a roiling pit of tentacles,</em>” I whisper.</p>
<p>E grins, and my hand is behind eir neck, and I kiss eir lips like I want to devour em. The goo around us fill with tendrils red and fleshy, velvet purple, and striped black-and-white. They wrap around my feet, legs, and buttocks, up my hips and over my waist and back, drawing slime with them where they move.</p>
<p>Sloane emself dissolves between my fingers into writhing tendrils. I’m hooked by the shoulders by strong, thick tentacles, and pulled into the pool; from below, I’m carried on the surface by eir gentle touch, half-submerged. Writhing forms move over my body, and slither titillatingly across my cock, my balls, my taint, and my ass.</p>
<p>From within the writing mass now taking up the entirety of the enormous tub, I see a single, narrow red tendril emerge , making its way towards my cock. A striped tentacle ever so gently slides under my cock and angle it upwards. The red tendril snakes its way into the air, and runs a tapering tip up along my shaft, before wiggling under my foreskin and sliding it back frictionlessly.</p>
<p>Then it pauses at my urethra and slides in. I jerk forward as much as I can against the hold of the velvet arm-sized tendrils holding me. “Oh <em>fuck.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“<em>You taste so good.</em>”</p>
</div>
<p>I feel it sliding inside me, faster and less probing than when we did it this morning, and then it reaches my prostate and starts vibrating there. It feels incredible.</p>
<p>Along the red tendril in my cock, follows a white-black one, from which the red is emanating from a mouth-like orifice at the tip like a tongue. It reaches the tip of my cock, and slides over it; feeling like eir divinely soft cunt around my shaft.</p>
<p>Another white-black tendril follows shortly, this one almost two inches in diameter, its tip is split open in an angled leaf-shaped reddish surface with a small orifice in the middle. It pushes against my ass, and barely meets any resistance, pistoning into me and against my prostate from there.</p>
<p>Another whale cock snakes up my torso and into my mouth. A narrow red tendril probes my nostril, and another my ear. Then I am pulled under the water. I barely get a breath of air before I am plunged below, and an orgasm takes me right as it happens.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«<em>I love you my clement horizon.</em>»</p>
</div>
<p>The need for breath begins burning in my chest, and a wave of nectar shoots into my stomach from eir tentacle cock pistoning down my throat. Strong bulging shapes massage me; from a heavy-handed churning against my back and spine, to painfully pleasant underfoot massage, to a delicate loosening of my metacarpals.</p>
<p>I come again. The burning in my chest diminishes.</p>
<p>A tongue licks my eyeball, and I revel in the incredibly intimate feeling. Every inch of me is probed and felt and <em>tasted.</em> A tendril enters my nose, and another, my ear.</p>
<p>This is what e is. Not a habitually feminine-adjacent humanoid with prehensile feet, or an amazonian horned devil. E is mine. My shapeshifting demigod of high-flying freedom and the True Sea; stylistic consistency of body plan is a <em>passing fancy.</em></p>
<p>This; this I want forever. To be fucked in every orifice, and everywhere else too.</p>
<p>Vaguely, I feel a closeness in spirit to something or someone — almost like my fingertips brush against another’s body in this roiling mass of tentacles submerged in a tub that is increasingly less water and slime and increasingly more pure nectar; there are other tentacles here than Sloane.</p>
<p>I send a silent prayer — my mouth is full of cock and even then it is hard enough to think straight — to whomever else is there; but Sloane is mine, and I am eirs. And as I think that thought to end, the closeness fades.</p>
<p>I’ve lost track of how many orgasms I’ve had. I’ve lost track of time. Gentle sucking mouths tend to my nipples. I stop thinking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Suddenly I’m no longer being fucked to high heaven, and a strong hand pulls me up to the surface; I see Sloane, looking slightly worried, and through the haze of pleasure, all I can do is grin. “Why’d you stop?” I slur.</p>
<p>I find my feet on the slick bottom of the tub.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Morg, are you okay?”</p>
</div>
<p>“I feel <em>amazing,</em> but you probably already know.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yeah, well, you just <em>changed,</em> suddenly.”</p>
</div>
<p>I look at my hands. Still, ring and bracelets, still hexagons on my left and flowers on the right although they are not as I remember them — more intertwined, more grandiose. My hands are more slender than I remember.</p>
<p>On my chest, are actual breasts — maybe a b-cup; slick with nectar, I can’t help but give them a squeeze. It feels nice.</p>
<p>Between my legs, some more significant remodeling has taken place. My cock is plain gone, and in its place I have a delicately furred — though said fur is <em>drenched</em> — cunt. “This isn’t half bad.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“It was a little bit concerning; kinda sudden. I think I lost the part of me that was in your prostate — not that I’m hurt. Just… Surprised.”</p>
</div>
<p>I wave a hand — my coordination is pretty much shot. “Pshaw; I’m sure this happens <em>all</em> the time. And!” I hold up one finger.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“What?”</p>
</div>
<p>I wade though the thick nectar, as sultrily as I can — which is not very — “Now you get to teach me <em>all</em> the pleasures of having a <em>cunt.</em>”</p>
<p>Sloane blushes bright pink on eir white cheeks, and I giggle. “Can you make a mirror? I’d like to look at my ass before you fuck me silly again.”</p>
<p>At my request, e unfolds what almost seems like a wing. The dark flesh turns silver, then smoothes over. I get my first look at what I would have ended up looking like with two X chromosomes and statistically normal estrogen levels during puberty.</p>
<p>“Yoo~, I’m <em>sexay,</em>” I say. My tattoos are all intact, as are my piercings. My tongue is still split, and I’m still bald. I’m curvaceous, but not outrageously so, and broad shouldered like my mom and my dad’s sisters. Lean limbs, no thigh gap what so ever, and my ass is fucking amazing.</p>
<p>I turn to Sloane. “Okay, I’m ready.” I spread my arms out.</p>
<p>Sloane’s feeler’s lash behind my back, and e pulls me towards eir advancing form.</p>
<p>“Can I do a request? I love your tits and all, but can you do full <em>hunk</em> for this part?”</p>
<p>Eir tits flatten out into well-defined pecs, and as I watch, e gains maybe a hand of shoulder width. Muscles bulge over eir iliac crest, and eir cock rises to attention — all eight inches of it. Our bodies meet, and it presses against my stomach with nothing in the way.</p>
<p>A tasteful red goatee graces eir chin. I’ve been so distracted from all the bodily changes that I’ve neglected to notice the prominent brow, the sharp nose, dark eyes, and defined jaw line. Still the same lips. I clasp eir well-defined buttocks, and our lips meet. Eir hands stroke me up the small of my back.</p>
<p>There are few things as intensely arousing to me, as how Sloane is just the personification of every boundary-transgressive fantasy I have ever had.</p>
<p>A pair of hands land on my shoulder blades, and a tongue licks my ear. I break the kiss to turn and see Sloane’s face next to mine. Full cheeks, delicate nose and brow ridge, soft jawline, doe-eyes. E steps into view giving me a peek at eir over-the-top curves, full and perky tits, and mind-boggling hourglass figure.</p>
<p>“Whoa. You can do clones?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Of course —” I say.</p>
<p>But with what mouth? Taking a mental inventory of my newly paralell mind.</p>
<p>“— What did you think?”</p>
<p>“And no, it’s not clones —”</p>
<p>“— I’m one mind. Two bodies.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Oh god, you speak in tandem.”</p>
<p>And with the same, gloriously androgynous, molasses-dark honey-smooth voice.</p>
<p>He twirls me around and I land on my butt in the nectar with a splash, on the built-in bench that circles the tub. She dives below, and comes to a rest between my legs — the nectar distorts less than water, so I get treated to the sight of her unfurling foot-long tongue, right before it makes contact with my clit.</p>
<p>It’s intense, like a Tenga sleeve; I know the numbers by heart, twice the nerves in a dozen-fourth of the surface area. I moan on purpose and with gusto, and my hand finds her hair; it’s many times more intense than any blowjob.</p>
<p>He swings a leg over me, resting on his knees, and his cock is in my face. His glorious, beautiful, enormous cock. With my free hand, I scoop up a handful of nectar and rub it ferverently over his length, before grabbing it and shoving it in my mouth. I put my hand on his tailbone and <em>push</em> until my nose hits his pubic mound. He gets the idea of vigorously face-fucking me without prompting. <em>Empaths!</em></p>
<p>Her tongue peeks inside me. It feels as intense as as any rimming, but without the edge of potential pain; it tickles in the same part of my sensorium as those rare occasions someone sucked on my balls. Her lips descend over my clit, and the sucking pushes me over the edge — except there isn’t one. I just take off, surfing on a wave of crisp pleasure.</p>
<p>I moan around his cock. He puts two hands on my head, picking up speed. She takes hold of my hips and tries to do something I can only describe as <em>drinking</em> me. I wrap my legs around her head, and put my other hand on his ass. Her hands vanish from my hips, and I can guess where they go. He groans and bottoms out in my mouth.</p>
<p>And then I discover that I was mistaken about orgasms. My mind whites out with burning pleasure. Lightning shoots through my entire body. I scream best as I can with a gigantic cock going almost past my larynx; it comes out mostly as a gurgle.</p>
<p>When it finally passes, my legs are shaking, and my hands are trembling, and I can barely speak.</p>
<p>He pulls away from my mouth, and she comes up to kiss me, drenched in nectar that sticks in her long red hair and runs in rivulets down her tits. They both pull me up and we kiss — first her, then him, then they make out passionately, and I remember the twin-incest fetish I had forgotten I had.</p>
<p>Then he’s behind me, with his hard cock against my ass, and she draws me forward, crawling out of the bath, presenting herself to me, sitting on the lip of the pool. I bend forward, come to rest on my knees on the bench below the waterline, well-knowing I am presenting my ass and cunt to him.</p>
<p>I dive into her cunt, focusing on her clit with the singular intensity my cleft tongue can provide, drinking the nectar and moans that begins flowing out of her.</p>
<p>Then the head of his cock meets my entrance, and a shiver goes up my spine. He pushes and I arch backwards as his massive length enters my untested cunt. It’s at least half again as good as anal; I feel things inside me move slightly, in a way that pleasantly accounts for the extra space his cock takes up. She pulls me down to her sex again, and I get to moan and groan into her hot red flesh as he slowly ramps up the pace.</p>
<p>It feels like no time passes, before I am holding on to her pelvis with both hands, arms slung under her thighs, while he pounds away as fast as my heart is beating, with the nectar in the pool splashing everywhere. I reach another climax and it feels like I’m flying, soaring like the pair of solid-rocket boosters on a space shuttle <em>and I’m the fuel.</em></p>
<p>They come at the same time, judging by the modest gushing and how she arcs her back artfully, splaying open her legs; but what I’m really paying attention to is the gallon of nectar that rushes into my hungry cunt. Gushing spurt after gushing spurt, prolonging my orgasm with natural ease, and a part of me is almost disappointed when it stops.</p>
<p>Strong arms grab me by the shoulders and lift me up against him. He hooks his arms under my shoulders, and she slips back into the pool while he walks us backwards to the center. She ducks down, hoking her hands behind my knees, and lifts me up until my knees hit my sides. His cock slips from my cunt, and I almost ‘boo,’ but then I see another cock emerging from her groin.</p>
<p>With a bit of excellently coordinated adjusting, I feel his cock against my ring, just as her cockhead meets the folds of my cunt. They push into me at the same time and I can only hold on as they settle into an alternating rhythm of double penetration. I hold on for dear life, one hand behind his neck, the other on her shoulder.</p>
<p>“<em>Oh god we should do this all the time,</em>” I eke out between moans.</p>
<p>He bits my ear, and she leans in to kiss me with that foot-long tongue. She grows an extra set of arms to massage my tits, he grows and extra set of arms to cup my ass and rub my clit.</p>
<p>I’m a screamer. Every previous orgasm I’ve moaned or groaned have been in denial of this blaringly obvious fact. She doesn’t silence me with a kiss, but leans in to kiss him instead. Their feelers intertwine, and their pace quickens. I crest a wave of my orgasm only to find the ship-sinking storm surge beyond the next valley.</p>
<p>My cunt and ass fill with prodigious quantities of nectar, and it feels like I’m bulging and expanding to accommodate the storm flood even though I’m not.</p>
<p>They slow, with their orgasms, and come to a rest.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«<em>We could —</em>» I purr in eir ear.</p>
<p>«<em>— but we won’t.</em>»</p>
</div>
<p>“What?” I slur, through lust-addled thoughts, the aftershocks of orgasm, and with shaking, quivering <em>everything.</em></p>
<p>Two cocks exit me, one from my ass with a <strong><em>pop</em></strong>. Gentle strong arms help me to the edge of the pool, and up on dry land. There’s a set of benches lining the walls around. While I hang on for dear life in his strong arms, she casually lifts one, placing it away from the wall, in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>He sits me down at the end of it, and pushes me back down to lie — the seat is padded leather, and comfortable enough for me to fall asleep then and there.</p>
<p>I don’t, because she walks into view. Her cock is different — it’s longer and has got that same leaf-shaped flared tip. Also she has a tight scrotum under it, rather than the cunt I was expecting.</p>
<p>As I watch, seemingly, a triplet of stones descend into the pouch — as large as chicken eggs — and the pouch distends some. Then another. And another. I prop myself up on one elbow to really see how she takes a slightly wider stance while the pouch between her legs starts looking like a balloon full of ping pong balls.</p>
<p>She pushes between my legs with her shins, and I am forced to open up as she gets on her knees between mine. She lays her cock out over my belly, and there is no way it will fit — but then again, I just went into a pool with a cock and came out with a cunt.</p>
<p>Then next to us, he puts down another bench, perpendicular to the one I’m lying on, meeting it right by my head. He sits down, asride it, facing me, legs wide, and cock on display.</p>
<p>I watch his erect shaft split down the middle, separating into four tendrils with soft red mucous membrane inside. At the base of his cock is a dark hole. The separation line opens into his scrotum, and I watch unfurl a cunt with writhing tentacular labia. The entrance itself into this monstrous orifice, is a union between the hole in his cock, and his cunt. From my vantage point, I see another tendril make itself know, and it is hard not to recognize it as a <em>tongue.</em></p>
<p>There is nothing other to do than lean in for a kiss. The wet tendrils embrace my face, slip down my chest to ensnare my nipples, and my mouth meets lips that aren’t lips. Tongue kissing is good when your partner produces any amount of nectar, but this is drinking it straight from the mouth-cunt of another, like chugging from a a pitcher. One of the tendrils slither into my eye, and <em>licks</em> across it with all manner of tenderness, another slips up my nose and down the back of my velum into my throat. Every touch on me from them sends a shudder through him, and he moans something in Infernal. Ideally, I’d want to fuck this hole with a cock, but beggars can’t be choosers.</p>
<p>She leans back, and aligns her long cock with my cunt, then pushes in easily. I revel in the feeling of penetration. She pistons in and out a few times, going deeper with each thrust, and then I finally feel it brush against something odd. I feel a jolt of discomfort that vanishes with my next gulp of nectar. The backstroke is nice, and the forward stroke is again painful.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“That’s your cervix.”</p>
</div>
<p>She pushes forward, and hits resistance again, but this time she takes time. Something itches inside me, and a gulp of nectar makes it go away.</p>
<p>Then a white-hot intensity shoots through me, as she bottoms out. I draw back from the tongue-cunt, to see what she’s doing.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“And now I’m in your womb.”</p>
</div>
<p>She starts pistoning a little, and it feels like a hot iron poker made of ambiguous pleasure. I close my eyes, hissing, and a strong hand pushes be onto my back. He swings his leg over my bench and comes to a stop with his genital tentacles hanging into my face. Then he sits down on my face, my nose digging into the dorsal rim of his cunt.</p>
<p>I hear a feminine groan, and feel it happen. Her cock expands massively at the base, and for a moment my mind goes to dogs knotting; then I feel it moving up the shaft, inside my cunt, before reaching the cervix. It feels like what I imagine giving birth is like, except in reverse, with a significantly smaller object passing, and with a good amount of pain swapped for pleasure.</p>
<p>I scream in pain and orgasmic bliss when it passes — as well as I can with someone sitting on my face — and they scream too.</p>
<p>Then I know — how I know this, I know not — I <em>know</em> that he, sitting on my face, leans forward, and pulls her into a greedy kiss. The tongue in his cunt becomes a tubular tentacle, and nectar flows into me.</p>
<p>Another egg comes though her cock and into me, and another orgasm comes to me and her. The pain is lesser this time.</p>
<p>She keeps pistoning into me in short thrusts, afraid to pull out too far. Another egg starts coming, pushing past my outer lips inside her member. Every time one passes, it’s like her cock grows to double size, stretching my cunt beyond what should be possible, but for such a short time that no damage occur. It hits my cervix, and this time there’s no pain. Just bubbly, floating, rocket-propelled orgasm.</p>
<p>His cunt-tongue withdraws from my mouth, and his tentacles uncoil from my head. He rises off me, and sits on the bench above my head; then takes me by the shoulders to lift me up to sitting. She pushes forwards and under me, until I’m sitting astride her lap with her cock — ovipositor? — still in my womb.</p>
<p>Behind me, he snuggles closer, and his cock now reformed… I white out, as another egg goes into me… His cock slips into my ass, and his hands find my nipples. The role he takes feels secondary to my coitus, my role as make-believe egg incubator — like he’s a <em>midwife.</em></p>
<p>Another egg, another scream of pleasure in unison, My hands go to my belly, which has begun showing. She leans in to kiss me greedily and suck on my nipple. Slowly and in strange synchrony, they grind into my cunt and ass, every minute or so, giving me another egg.</p>
<p>Orgasm, after orgasm, as my belly swells egg by egg, and my mind gradually blanks.</p>
<hr />
<p>I come to, in the bed, nestled between her and him, with my belly distended as if I was eight months pregnant. As I lie there in the darkness, hearing the absence of their breathing, feeling the warmth of their skin on mine, I feel a little pop inside, and the now familiar subtle indications of a nectar release.</p>
<p>Every few minutes, another of the eggs pop, little balloons full of nectar. I run a finger in slow circles around my clit, which grows a little every once in a while. After an hour, it begins to become obvious that my clit is growing into a cock.</p>
<p>By the end of the process, to the knowledge I can gain by intimate self-inspection, I’ve become as Sloane customarily is; the Infernal word is literally «versatile-sexed.»</p>
<p>I don’t wake em to celebrate; I snuggle up, little-spoon to Him. His semi-erect cock goes between my cheeks, and pull Her in to be my little spoon. Sleep takes me easily after that.</p>
