<p>The book store is…</p>
<p>Let me level with you: I am thirty two and I am, and have always been, a total nerd. And while I majored in computer science, while almost all the reading I ever did after graduating high school was online — books have always held a spot near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>I was the twenty-something undergrad who read textbooks for fun. I was the one with the encyclopedic knowledge of sci-fi and fantasy — except for all the stuff that was on TV or the silver screen. Amazon was a godsend. An E-reader was higher priority than a smartphone.</p>
<p>Up until fatherhood hit me like a surprisingly pleasant sledgehammer, I was an aspiring author. Of textbooks, of philosophical think pieces, of fantasy novels.</p>
<p>This book store, Sloane has taken me to, is everything I hoped and more.</p>
<p>Right at the entrance is a counter with a bored looking bespectacled fellow — human, but I’m not sure, judging from the eight eyes he has — behind it, reading something.</p>
<p>Beyond him, is an <em>ocean</em> of shelves spaced so narrowly Sloane has to move sideways. It smells like old wood and musty paper.</p>
<p>My memory has been faring distinctly better since my first taste of nectar, so I begin my <em>list.</em></p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Here’s what we need — bear with us.»</p>
</div>
<p>«So long as you have coin or credit, your desire for a book is my pleasure to fulfil.»</p>
<p>“Okay,” I say. “I’m just gonna go down the list. First and foremost, I need introductory textbooks in Infernal, and an English-Infernal dictionary if he has it.”</p>
<p>Sloane translates, and I continue: “I need the guide he has for folk from lost worlds. I need a manual on etiquette — sexual and otherwise. I need a city map. I need an abridged religious texts, and theological analyses thereof. I need a book on mysticism. I need an introduction to philosophy. I need an almanac. I need a lay-man’s guide to cosmology. I need history books. I need social studies books. I need an introductory economics textbook. I need an introductory engineering textbook.”</p>
<p>Sloane confers all this, and the attendant scribbles down things in a notebook.</p>
<p>“I need an introductory text in sorcery. I need a book about succubi. I need a manual on dreamwalking — are there other disciplines like those?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>It takes me a moment to switch mental gears. “Uh, like esoteric practices that aren’t in general possible in material plane physics? Stonesinging, Gardening, Aetherwork, Smithing, and Dreaming.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Introductory texts on those. I need a mathematical reference works — analysis, statistics, geometry, numeric methods, algebra. Do you use tables of mathematical functions in book form?” — Sloane nods — “Natural exponential, natural logarithm, the Gaussian, the error function, the sine, tangent, secant, and arcs thereof.”</p>
<p>The eight-eyed gentleman raises an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Hm. I need an encyclopedia. I need a biograph or two written by people from lost worlds who incubated — that’s the term, right? — a succubus and went to the True Sea. I need a really good work of realistic fiction, and one of speculative fiction if such a thing exists. I need a poetry collection. I need — does the <em>Kama Sutra</em> exist here?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«… And the <em>Kama Sutra.</em>»</p>
</div>
<p>«What a voracious reader! Folk after my own heart! I’ll be right back.»</p>
<p>The clerk rushes in between the shelves, leaving us here.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“How are you going to read all that?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Like I’m running out of time, like tomorrow won’t arrive, like I need it to survive; which I do. First, I need you to be my teacher. Ever taught someone Infernal in a week?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I don’t think that’s possible…”</p>
</div>
<p>“If my hypothesis is correct, nectar is messing with my brain. I’ve always wanted to be a polyglot, but I never had the time to learn more than two. Regrettably, it seems Infernal is the lingua franca of — how many people live in the True Sea?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“About a trillion.”</p>
</div>
<p>I blink a few times. “<em>Fuck</em> me.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Well, we have a few minutes before he returns, so…”</p>
</div>
<p>“You know what I meant.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I blow a raspberry.</p>
</div>
<p>«Here is the first batch — I went for the tables first.»</p>
<p>He puts a stack of narrow black paperbacks down, and I take the topmost one and flip through it. It’s a mathematical table, but I can’t figure out which function — my Infernal seximal is a little non-existent.</p>
<p>It takes a half-hour, by my count, for the clerk to fetch it all. Over a hundred books, with the encyclopedia itself taking up twenty-nine volumes, and the <em>Kama Sutra</em>, ten.</p>
<p>Sloane hesitates some at the quoted price. E doesn’t fork over a handful of golden coins, but rather writes a cheque for credit — I read the name of the <em>Gehenna</em> written in Infernal. Of course she can bump the bill up to the Quartermaster.</p>
<p>Transaction conducted, I begin laboriously shoving every single one of the hundred-plus books into my bag. Sloane pitches in, putting the encyclopedia away in eirs.</p>
<p>I wave at the clerk as we leave.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“That set me <em>way</em> back,” I say as we step out of the <em>Books &amp; Books &amp; Books</em>. “I’m technically indebted now.”</p>
<p>I look back up at the rickety wooden facade. I’m not even sure how we found it.</p>
</div>
<p>“What?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Nothing, just… This place seems <em>off,</em> somehow.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Gift horses,” I say. Subconsciously I pat the bag of holding at my hip, which now contains a <em>libary</em> of valuable knowledge. “Let’s get back to that amazing hotel, up to our no-doubt amazing room, so I can get out of my clothes and we can go lie naked in bed and <em>read.</em>”</p>
<p>It’s a short walk back to the Golden Flower Vales hotel. It’s a short walk up seven flights of stairs.</p>
<hr />
<p>Our room is…</p>
<p>Well, I’ve never had the penthouse suite. Not in the post-crisis market, with a mediocre job and having settle with a family at a young age, were my housing prospects — or even entertainment budge — up to snuff.</p>
<p>The main room is large, luxuriously furnished with futon arrangements and piles of pillows, and also contains the master bedroom. The master bed not only looks invitingly soft, but has a set of manacles attached to the headboard.</p>
<p>The other room is a bathhouse, complete with sauna and a small pool.</p>
<p>Both rooms have large panoramic windows, and <em>no curtains.</em></p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“So are you serious about wanting to read?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Yes. Sorry. I love you and all, but it’s only been what — two hours since you screwed my brains out?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Fair enough.”</p>
</div>
<p>I pull out the English-Infernal and Infernal-English dictionaries, and the beginner’s textbook. “Now: <em>Inferni.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“All right.”</p>
</div>
<p>“<em>Inferni,</em>” I say, waving the book for emphasis.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>«Fine. Infernal.»</p>
</div>
<p>«Yes,» I say.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I point to myself. «Sloane, Succubus.»</p>
</div>
<p>“No— we’re not doing that,” I say. “and by my guess that second word means succubus. The way to go about this is to get me conversational ASAP. That means —” I page through the Infernal-English dictionary and find the page I am looking for “— training the most common words and basic grammar.”</p>
<p>The dictionary has a section that lists the one thousand, two-hundred ninety-six most used words in descending order, and accompanying page numbers.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“If we are doing this,” I say, stepping closer, “we are doing it naked and in bed.”</p>
</div>
<hr />
<p>When the wandering star passes, casting the sky-line outside in twilight, we have made inroads on the land of Infernal. I’ve meticulously made several decks of flash-cards, an invention foreign to Sloane, for memorizing the somewhat extraneously complex writing system, for seximal arithmetic, for vocabulary, for inflection, for short sentences with transitive and intransitive verbs.</p>
<p>Infernal has so many inflections. The morpheme inventory seems never-ending, and the word order is emphatic, rather than syntactic. This is a hurdle to overcome seeing as my brain runs on English and Swedish, with trace amounts of French and German — a particularly masochistic part of me wishes I had taken Latin.</p>
<p>There’s a noun case for just specifying the cause of things. There’s a noun case for specifying how you know what you’re saying. There’s a noun case for specifying physical positions, and one for movement. I thank the ghost of Noam Chomsky that the declension system is entirely regular — either a word ends in a vowel or a consonant, either it’s real or abstract. It has no gendered pronouns, but rather splits into sapient — humans, succubi, <em>stars and whales</em>; merely sentient, and non-sentient. It has the reflexive possessive I always missed in English after learning of it in Swedish.</p>
<p>Verbs conjugate thankfully not over grammatical person, but unfortunately in tenses past, present, and future; in aspects simple, participate, and progressive; and in a whole host of moods, many of them drawing on strange noun cases. There is no passive voice, and I feel thousands of academics cry out in pain, then being silenced.</p>
<p>The grammatical numbers are a mirror of the seximal orders of magnitude — with six being colloquially being the <em>pauchal</em> number — ‘a few,’ and thirty-six being plural. Nouns without grammatical numbers are uncountable by default. It’s also possible to classify objects with particles in a completely separate mess of language features.</p>
<p>It’s a never-ending well of alien grammar and perplexing cognates.</p>
<p>Sloane has been skimming some of the religious texts and theology, then reading the <em>Kama Sutra</em>, while I have been busting my ass memorizing things.</p>
<p>“What’s up?” I ask, rubbing my eyes, and look up.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I shrug.</p>
</div>
<p>I note the unusual reaction — e usually has something to say. “Is something the matter?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“I found some incongruity.”</p>
</div>
<p>“Between?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I put the book in my lap aside, and run my hands over my knees. “Captain Raven basically… Raised me. She took me in when I was whisked away from you for my own safety — it’s a pretty common thing — and taught me basically everything I know.”</p>
</div>
<p>“And?” I ask.</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I pick up the theological analysis. “Like, the most accepted interpretation of Lilith’s doctrines are completely apolitical — or rather, only political insofar as social creatures naturally play status games. Raven used to rant about the obstructionist policies of Lilim, but there’s <em>nothing</em> about that. Indeed, <em>Vena</em> seem more obstructionist and bureaucratic — Lilim plays petty tribal politics at <em>best</em>.”</p>
</div>
<p>“So she’s unorthodox,” I say. “There’s room for interpretation.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Well, yeah… It’s just— I’m just thinking about what else she might have taught me that was her ‘interpretation’ of things.”</p>
</div>
<p>I purse my lips. I am familiar with the feeling; or at least I empathise. “You know; where I am from, one of the steps towards maturity is realising the fallibility of your role models.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“Yeah, I’m familiar with the concept.”</p>
</div>
<p>I shake my head. “You came into existence thirteen years ago, right? Even if we correct for childhood, I’m easily twice as old as you. I had something similar happen to me — my parents broke up; that was actually after I incubated you. I lost a lot of faith in them both because of it.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“You expected them to be monogamous?” I ask, somewhat incredulously.</p>
</div>
<p>I shrug. “I at least expected better of them both than to have mid-life crises and flirt with infidelity. It was harder on my little brother.”</p>
<p>I get up and shimmy over to plop down on the futon next to em. “Point is, if Captain Raven is kid of your parent, then you should consider that you have been under her tutelage for thirteen years, and maybe it’s time you leave the nest. You’re familiar with the concept, but now you’re living it.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I frown. “She’s… It just doesn’t feel right. She might get angry.”</p>
</div>
<p>That sets off a red flag. “Why would she be angry that her valued crew member is making emself more of an asset?”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>“It’s just a vibe I get, OK? Empath thing.”</p>
</div>
<p>This is certainly a mystery I need to get to the bottom of. From what I know — limited as it may be — e picks up things far subtler than imaginable. Fearing Raven’s wrath over irrational things — that is a classic trauma reaction indicative of abuse.</p>
<p>“Look, I don’t doubt you. Your feelings are <em>important</em> to me. I will run away with you to the ends of the True Sea if that is what you want. And if Raven did anything to you, she will have to answer to <em>me.</em>”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I snicker. “She could rip you in half, you know?”</p>
</div>
<p>I shake my head. “Not without my consent. And besides, I think if it came down to it I have every confidence that you would stop her.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I turn and wrap em up in a hug. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>We pull apart, and Morgan caresses my cheek. I lean in for a kiss, and our lips meet. I wonder why I ever doubted that e would be perfect for me.</p>
</div>
<p>«I need a break,» I say. Literally: «need» «break-time» «I» «(by personal-evaluation)»</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I repeat the phrase, correcting some pronunciation, and Morgan repeats it back to me. «Let’s make love,» I say.</p>
</div>
<p>I analyse the sentence: «?» «(future tense lovemaking)» «dual-we»</p>
<p>«Yes please.»</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I push em back, down on the futon, and creep up between eir legs. E lies back, and I run a hand over eir bulging shorts. At some point in reading the <em>Kama</em> I shifted away my own cock because it got in the way of the book in my lap.</p>
<p>Swiftly, I undo the buttons of eir shirt — by slipping small tendrils in under the hem and up through the button holes. I bend down and lick eir chest from solar plexus to jugular notch. I grip eir lapels, and pull the button-down out of eir shorts with some force.</p>
<p>I shift another pair of arms to caress eir chest with while I life up eir beautiful face, for a deep and passionate kiss. I let my elongated, thigh tongue slide down eir throat, which makes em moan. My extra hands find eir nipples, and I add a third pair to unbutton eir shorts. I pull them off eir hips, and down eir shapely legs.</p>
<p>Still kissing, my lowest arms begin stroking eir cock and fingering my clitoris. Rivulets of nectar run down my thighs, and eir cock reach an almost painfully erect state. I hook my middle hands behind eir knees, and lift eir legs up and back.</p>
<p>Our lips part, as I move em.</p>
</div>
<p>“I love how we just skip foreplay.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>There’s cheekiness and humor in eir statement. A playfulness radiating off em, mixed with lust. My hand finds eir cheek, and I poke a thumb between eir lips, silencing em. Eagerly e starts suckling on my thumb, with no small amount of pleasure.</p>
<p>I rise from my knees to my feet, squatting with my cunt over eir crotch. With my lower hands, I take hold of eir cock, and gently guide it downwards, out from eir belly, until it meets my cunt.</p>
<p>Pushing forwards — as if I was thrusting with my own cock — e slides into me. It’s a little trick from the <em>Kama</em>. It feels every bit as amazing as always. Indeed it feels like my cunt has received far too little attention. Especially it feels so, since this delicious cock has grown an inch longer since the first time I took it in my mouth.</p>
<p>There’s a hint of recognition in eir emotions. I gyrate my hips back, the forth again, making em thrust into me once more. My lower hand finds my clitoris and I begin making slow circles across it with a fingertip, the other hand I put on the back of eir thigh. I run my middle hands up eir calves, taking hold of eir heels, pushing back eir legs even more.</p>
<p>I begin gyrating rhythmically, impaling myself, savoring the feeling of my insides being pushed aside at every thrust. From deep within me, the roiling current of orgasm begin to murmur far under a still surface.</p>
<p>My tail sheds its furry tuft, and mass flows into it forming a thick tentacle. Sensation form under the skin, creating an erogenous zone.</p>
<p>Rather than willing lubricating nectar through my skin, I plunge it into my ass — its pointed tip making for easy passage beyond my ring. A jolt of pleasure goes through me, right as I push forward onto eir cock. My eyes cross, then close, and I have to steel myself not to come right then and there. There’s a little blip of Morgan finding my lapse of self-control adorable.</p>
<p>When I retract it, it is coated in slick juice, and I probe Morgan’s tight ring. A spike of eir already considerable lust flares burning from eir cock into my folds.</p>
<p>Familiar with fucking eir ass it as I am, it is easy enough to find and push my tail into em. E gives a spectacular moan around my thumb, and I shudder with eir ring clamping down around my sensitive tail tip. I curl the tip towards me, against eir prostate, and start making slow circles with it.</p>
<p>E moans and claws at the futon bed, and I pick up the pace. My pleasure boils over, and my orgasm rises like an oncoming tide. Morgan arcs backwards, and I feel eir seed shoot into my hungry cunt, and I swallow it reflexively.</p>
<p>Orgasm takes me, and the wave of nectar rushing through me needs someplace to go; to spill out of my cunt, or precipitate through my tail, or gurgle up my throat. Instead, I force it all down inside, creating a reservoir in my belly, which swells and swells and swells.</p>
<p>My climax subsides, as does eirs. I rub a hand over my swollen abdomen, and feel the liquid sloshing inside. Were I a human, I’d look pregnant.</p>
</div>
<p>“That— that can’t all have been me.”</p>
<div class="slo">
<p>I shake my head. “Nothing goes to waste,” I say with a sly grin. I lean forward, belly sloshing, arms extending for support against the mattress, and we kiss, deeply and passionately.</p>
<p>I draw back, and caress eir face with a hand. “<em>That</em> was foreplay.”</p>
<p>Then I rise up to my previous position, and <em>invert</em>. The back of my head becomes my face, every dorsal feature dissolving and reforming as ventral and vice versa. In an eye-blink, I am in the reverse amazon position.</p>
<p>Out of my still-impaled cunt, my cock grows, subsuming my clit. I lift my rear a little, making Morgan’s cock slide out to the tip, and then angle my already pre-come-leaking cock downward towards eir tight asshole. My sensitive tail-tip finds a home in eir mouth, and I push forwards, my cock sliding past eir ring, and eir cock sliding into me.</p>
<p>There’s no slow, gentle buildup this time — we are both mind-numbingly horny despite our mutual orgasms; me perhaps more so. The weight in my belly makes it hard to thrust with abandon but it doesn’t take many dozen thrusts before I feel my pleasure boiling over again, and as the climax takes me, I open the flood gates on the reservoir of nectar in my belly, adding the stored fluid to the prodigious load I normally shoot.</p>
<p>The feeling of shooting it all inside em, drawn out like this, draws my orgasm itself out to nearly double length. It becomes almost mechanical, the rhythm of bottoming out for a pump of nectar, then drawing back in anticipation of the next.</p>
<p>By the end of it, curiously, Morgan hasn’t come yet, despite the incredibly content feeling e is giving off. Lashing back with my six arms, extending them to reach, I pull em up and myself forward, until e is taking me from behind. An immediate rut comes over eir movements, and e pushes me onto the mattress. I revoke my cock as it slides out of em, and open a channel in my tail tip, and let the slender tendril which never really had anything to do with my spine slither up between eir buttocsk, finding a home in eir ass.</p>
<p>E puts both hands on my buttocks and starts vigorously pounding me, eir cock sling past my inner thighs, while I thrust my slender, sensitive tail-tip in and out past eir tight ring. A thumb goes in my ass, and I can’t do much other than hold on tight.</p>
<p>I feel eir orgasm building to spectacular intensities, and e shoots a load into me before even reaching eir true climax. There is no slowing, or appreciating the pumps, just the continuing rhythm of bouncing against me. My own climax build from walls of my cunt and through my pelvis to the base of my tail. Pleasure expand up its entire length like a three cubit long cock, making my eyes cross, before erupting inside.</p>
<p>With a guttural groan at each thrust, eir little spurts of come shoot inside me. Still eir pleasure builds and builds, and as I feel eir climax approaching, so does my own. E makes a terrifying bellow, and bottoms out, unleashing a torrent of come into my innermost reaches, losing enough fluid to dehydrate a mortal. I drink it up; e continues; I loose track of time and space, reduced to a receptacle for come and a dispenser of nectar in exchange for rough fucking.</p>
<p>The sky is deep dark outside before e collapses on top of me, asleep.</p>
