<h1 class="title">chapter 14</h1>
</header>
<p>I don’t freak out.</p>
<p>There’s a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it darkness and then the rush of sounds from the active mooring terminal.</p>
<p>«That was impressively composed — like you were barely there,» Mustafa says, and gently sets me down.</p>
<p>«What usually goes wrong?» I ask.</p>
<p>«Oh, all sorts of things. If you’re one day in need of a Dreamwalking teacher—» he digs his hand in his pocket, and draws a calling card. It is white plastic with an intricate silver threading.</p>
<p>Then he disappears, just like Jaya did when she Dreamwalked — not even a pop of displaced air.</p>
<p>I turn towards the ship, and set into a run, up the ramp, into the corridor, and into the lounge.</p>
<p>I’m greeted by Dea, the First Mate. She’s dressed in a hornet-yellow corset and <em>nothing</em>, with bronzed skin, long flowing black hair, and a pair of full-sized golden, feathered wings on her back.</p>
<p>«Where is Sloane?» I ask.</p>
<p>«You speak infernal?» she asks, perplexed.</p>
<p>«Yes, I’m an amazingly fast learner; <em>where is Sloane?</em>»</p>
<p>She holds up a hand. «Listen, kid, you’re in my good books, and I’ll stand by you because you being here and interfering with Sloane poses a problem for the Captain, and I like seeing her suffer. I’m not helping you out of the goodness of my heart.»</p>
<p>I’ve never spoken to her before. «I don’t give an ounce of dust what you and the Captain do in your emotional lives, but the love of my life is hurt and somewhere on the ship and you will take me there.»</p>
<p>She smirks. «You’ve got spunk.» She turns and heads down the spine of the ship, and I follow.</p>
<hr />
<p>There’s no infirmary on the Gehenna, because why would there be? Nectar is <em>panacea</em> in every way.</p>
<p>Dea leads me to one of the many rooms along the spine of the ship, and we enter. Inside is a workspace lined with desks and book cases by the walls; the floor is free, and an encircled pentagram takes up most of it. In the middle is a field stretcher, whereupon I see Sloane.</p>
<p>She’s still diminutive in size, almost consumed by her velvet-worm aspect.</p>
<p>By her side stands the man I know as Ithquil, the Chief Warlock. His skin is grey, his eyes are fire, and his brow is graced by elegant horns, to match the pointy goatee on his chin; his slender build is garbed in an intricately embrodiered black tunic that reaches the floor.</p>
<p>Opposite of him stands Captain Raven, clad in a double slitted yellow floor-length skirt and many ornate neclaces.</p>
<p>Off to one side stands Kairiel, nude, and part of me notes that my enhanced vision pierces the optical effects that hides her exotic transparent flesh and emerald bones when motionless. Wanayoinke next to her is wearing a loin cloth, and it looks like his dark brown skin is oiled.</p>
<p>I stride forward, heedless of decorum or proper greetings, and stop at the foot of the stretcher. «What’s wrong?»</p>
<p>«I… <em>Don’t</em> know,» Ithquil says. «It is difficult to discern what it is, but I have conclusively ruled out several things it is <em>not.</em>»</p>
<p>«Such as?» I ask.</p>
<p>«Starvation, damage to the soul — even though there are changes, intentional self-harm, an elaborate ruse, a curse… My best guess is that dear Sloane is lost in a catatonic reverie — such is difficult to conclusively prove,» he says. His intonation is dry and academic; but with undertones of clear compassion. He looks genuinely worried.</p>
<p>«So e isn’t about to die?»</p>
<p>«No.»</p>
<p>I breathe a sigh of relief. «Thank Vena.»</p>
<p>«Perhaps you can be of service, dear Morgan,» Raven says. «What were you two doing when Sloane fell ill?»</p>
<p>«I’m not sure,» I say. I sit down on the stretcher and take Sloane’s little hand in mine. «I was unconscious for a spell, and when I came to e was like this.»</p>
<p>«You’re ommitting something,» Raven pries. «Sloane got hurt because of something <em>you</em> did, or am I wrong?»</p>
<p>I look up at her. Black eyes in black sockets surrounded by black feathers, with a black beak. Time slows while I come up with a reply. Dea was right, Raven is invested in Sloane. «Are you genuinely concerned, or is it because you feel like I’ve come to steal em away from you?»</p>
<p>«Both; does it matter?»</p>
<p>Interesting. I file her willingness to admit declasse motives away for later. «Sloane remade my body. I’ve not had time to examine it in detail, but I have a vague memory that I adivsed her to divide her mind into many in order to complete the task in time.»</p>
<p>Wanayoinke clears his throat. «That may be it.»</p>
<p>We all turn to look at him.</p>
<p>«Sloane confided in me once, called me to help em out — do you all remember that madman’s labyrinth trap? Afterwards, Slo went into eir room and didn’t come out for a day; e called me to help em with writing the report, because e couldn’t stop spacing out when e tried to remember the events.»</p>
<p>«Mnemestic reintegration run amok,» Ithquil says. «Presenting as catatonic reverie.»</p>
<p>«How do I fix it?» I ask.</p>
<p>«It should pass on its own when e is done reintegrating,» he says.</p>
<p>Look back down at Sloane. «And how long is that going to take?» I ask.</p>
<p>«Depends on how much e divided eir mind — do you know how complex the task was?»</p>
<p>I shake my head. «I’m going to guess and say <em>extremely,</em> because you’re looking at the fruits of that labor.»</p>
<p>«Kairiel since you’re not essential personnel here, could you fetch Oleg, Gorek, and Baahl please?» Raven says.</p>
<p>«Yes, Captain.» She darts out the door, a glistening shape full of green.</p>
<p>«There is one outstanding matter,» Ithquil says. «Sloane’s soul isn’t damaged, but it is <em>changed.</em> There’s a foreign but benign contamination. So far as I can discern, it oritinates from <em>you</em>, Morgan.»</p>
<hr />
<p>The three technicians arrive shortly: Gorek is massive, looming, and bearded; Oleg is lean, clean, and muscled. Both of them are in coveralls rolled down to their waists, showing off their impressive physiques. Baahl is a formless mass of tentacles.</p>
<p>«I need an assessment of Morgan, here,» Raven says, pointing to me.</p>
<p>Gorek and Oleg share a look, while Baahl slithers forward towards me. They come to a stop before me, and rise from the ground, with finger-width round-tipped tendrils poised towards me. «Permission to touch?» they ask.</p>
